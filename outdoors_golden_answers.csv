4410,1,Who places the anchors that rock climbers use?,a local enthusiast or group of enthusiasts,"There are two distinct styles of free rock climbing (with, as always, some grey areas). In ""trad"" (= traditional) climbing, the team carries their own removable gear. The leader places protection points whilst climbing and the second climber removes them again. There might be the odd piece of permanent gear - pitons or bolts - but the climbing team is basically responsible for arranging their own protection. In sport climbing, bolts are pre-placed by somebody , usually a local enthusiast or group of enthusiasts. How stuff is funded/maintained varies a lot from area to area, but it is almost always voluntary efforts of some kind. Formal standards don't exist, although most areas have best practices that are generally understood and adhered to by people putting in or maintaining fixed equipment. Exactly what these best practices are vary a lot from area to area depending on type of rock, proximity to salt water etc. IANAL, but from what I've read there might be some question of legal liability if people putting in fixed gear blatantly violate local best practices. Bolt spacing norms in particular vary a lot from area to area. One of my local areas is the Frankenjura. There the locals generally bolt the routes so you won't hit the ground, but they don't care how scared you are. So you might be looking at doing hard climbing much further above a - solid - bolt than you are used to or comfortable with. A couple of hours in the opposite direction is Nassereith in Austria, where the bolt spacing makes some climbing gyms feel terrifying.

5347,1,Who places the bolts on rock climbing routes?,the person who is creating the climb,"What you're talking about is Sport climbing. Generally these bolts are placed by the person who is creating the climb. They will normally top rope or abseil the climb and work out where they want it to go, then spend a couple of days placing the bolts, while on a top rope. They are drilled and glued into place and this can take a lot of time. Sometimes the person who places these will do the first ascent, sometimes not, this will often depend on the grade. Some test pieces are made deliberately very hard as a type of challenge to other climbers. Learning where to put the bolts is a skill unto itself and is more Art than science. Sometimes traditional routes are bolted. This is very controversial (in the UK at least) as traditional climbing enthusiasts feel this sometimes ruins good traditional routes.

20662,1,Who gets the bill if you activate a PLB to help someone else?,the victim,"Almost always the victim gets the bill, but as mentioned in commentary, it depends on locality and sometimes fault. Local rules always apply. As an example, in the US, some state authorities will assume the rescue costs except in cases of negligence of the victim. This is true even if the victim did not seek help - and this is one reason help is sometimes delayed by the victim, as they fear a large bill later on. But that can cause their problems to worsen over time, and in some cases, can cause others (eg, witnesses) to become endangered as they, themselves, engage in assist. To mitigate that, states or localities (even the feds) may contract out with certain rescue operators. But if a person seeks help either by themselves calling, or a witness calls for the victim, or even receives unsolicited help from unscrupulous emergency workers, then sometimes an emergency crew not contracted by the authority may perform the rescue, and in this case, the victim is nearly always the recipient of aid and bill. If the victim required help as a result of negligence from another or from property neglect of the authority, then the state will assume some or all of the rescue costs. And this is not always the case right away: sometimes, the victim gets the bill, but then has to go through legal channels to reverse this. Here's why: In most cases of insurance in the US, if a person is sick, their health insurance is the primary payer. In cases of accident, then, the party at fault is always the primary payer. In cases where the other party is not identified or has no or insufficient insurance, the victim's insurance covers the costs. That is why insurance is always exchanged in accidents: it's not only about who's covered but also about which insurance company will pay. In a rescue operation, whether it is police, national guard, or professional crews, or a mixture therein, they are part of the ""injured parties"" - they have incurred costs as well. They want those costs recovered as well, and fully expect that insurance companies will do that. They usually don't deal with insurance, so the bill goes directly to the victim. Many times, upon receipt of that bill, fault hasn't yet been legally established, which is why the victim usually gets the bill. Now, if you are on private property, things can change dramatically. While the victim is still usually the bill recipient, the landowner - not being the government anymore - is also a party to a suit where cost recovery is at issue. And if the property owner is not careful about safety, they can be equally liable. The reason for disparity has to do with sovereign immunity. The federal government almost always enjoys ""absolute"", and occasionally ""qualified"", immunity, which essentially means you can't sue them. States can also enjoy a limited degree of immunity as well; and counties and municipalities receive no such protection at all, thus, the reason for having permits and proof of insurance and indemnity waivers you have to go through, even to just have a picnic. So, your search and rescue operation is, by defacto, covered by your own insurance which you presented when you reserved your time on county or municipal land, but, not when you reserved your time on state or federal land.

We can narrow down the scope by studying when they are active. Rubber boa (Charina bottae) - Typically Nocturnal, very very rarely seen to be active in daylight. - Less likely to be the snake you saw. Western Yellow-bellied Racer (Coluber constrictor mormon) - Active during daylight One of the many species of Ring-necked Snake (Diadophis punctatus amabilis) - Very secretive behavior, active during night and about at dusk. - Less likely to be your snake. Baja California Ratsnake (Bogertophis rosaliae) - Nocturnal or crepuscular, unlikely to be the snake you saw. Sierra Gartersnake (Thamnophis couchii) - Active during daylight, Yes. But a known aquatic snake. So unlikely to be the one you saw. Do we have an answer? Some might say, Yes. I'd strongly say No. It can be a Western Yellow-bellied Racer, but I can't be sure unless we discuss about size of the snake.

Sometimes you have to solve clues or wander around the area gathering pieces of information before you get the final co-ordinates, these are known as multi-caches and mystery caches. You can of course place a new geocache out yourself and then register that with the site so others can find it.

24200,0,What attracts Spotted Lanternflies?,Tree of Heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ),"The favorite host tree of the Spotted Lanternfly is Tree of Heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ). There may be trees of heaven around your office building. However, spotted lanterflies aren't picky. They also like Almond trees, Grape vines, ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãPeach trees, Apple trees‚Äã, Hickory trees, Pine trees, Apricot trees, ‚ÄãHops vines, Plum trees, Basil, Horseradish, Sycamore trees, Blueberry bushes, Maple trees, Walnut trees, Cherry trees, Nectarine trees, Willow trees, ‚ÄãCucumber plants ‚Äãand Oak trees. So it's probably not because they're attracted to any particular plant species. Spotted lanternflys reproduce prolifically wherever they are. The reason you're noticing spotted lanternflies near your office, and not other places, is because they got to your office first. If the other places you go don't have spotted lanternflies, you could be at risk of spreading them to those other places. Lanternflies will lay eggs on a car or other vehicle. Please take precautions. The PA Dept of Agriculture has some great resources on the topic. The spotted lanterfly invasion is relatively new, and it's a big threat to agriculture. They were first found in the US in 2014, near Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is working hard to stop it from spreading. They're now also in Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and possibly other states that I'm not aware of. The respective state departments of agriculture are all working on containing and eradicating them. (If anyone knows of other states I should add to the list, please comment below.)

In Maryland, inform the Maryland Department of Agriculture at (410) 841-5920 or DontBug.MD@maryland.gov.

In Massachusetts, report through this online form . If you see spotted lanternflies outside the current quarantine zone, it's a big deal. Report them to your state department of agriculture immediately. Look at this quarantine zone map to figure out if your daily commute takes you from inside the quarantine zone to outside the quarantine zone. Inspect your vehicle for spotted lanternfly eggmasses before leaving the quarantine zone. Destroy any eggmasses before leaving. If that seems like too much effort (and it is a lot of work; I understand that) consider all the crops that could be destroyed by spotted lanternflies. How much more expensive will foods like blueberries, apples, cherries and grapes (and wine) be if those crops are wiped out in Pennsylvania?

It makes up for the short comings of each system, while incorporating their strengths to produce a more SRENE anchor. One of the criticisms of the cordalette is after you've tied the master knot, you have potentially poor equalization if you deviate from your set direction of pull. The sliding-x anchor offers auto-equalization, but at the expense of adding friction and elongation to your anchor system. Equalette: The below image shows an example of an equalette, it looks complicated at fist glance, but the strength of an equalette is that you can tie it with any combination of clove hitches and other knots to meet your needs given the availability of anchors on the rock, it's not necessarily meant to be tied the exact same way every time. For example, if you have four or more placements, then you can tie into them all using clove hitches vs using a figure eight on a bight on the third anchor in the image below. You adapt how you tie your equalette to your given situation. Image Credit: Freedom of the Hills The equalette is tied from 6m (20ft) of 7mm or smaller diametre accessory cord tied with a double or triple fishermans knot depending on the material of the cord. To set it up, first tie of a 25cm (10"") section with overhand limiter knots near the middle of the equalette, this is going to be your self-equalizing clip in point. Where exactly you tie it may be offset from centre depending on where your anchors are relative to the direction of pull, but wherever you tie it, you're going to be left with two larger loops on either side. This is where you're left to your own creativity, using any combination of knots, tie the loops to your anchors using one or more elements per side. Using two locking carabiners is preferable for clipping your rope to the equalette, clipping one biner into each of the loops between the limiter knots. You can still use just one carabiner, as long as you put a half twist in one of the loops to make a sliding-x, but this reintroduces friction into the system.

To climb such a route ""free"" requires a longer rope or adjusting the pitches to end at hands-free stances from which to belay.

10124,1,What is a recurve bow?,A bow whose string touches a section of the limb,"A bow whose string touches a section of the limb ... Yeah, all these different bows may confuse a beginner. However, it's generally really easy like in this case. A recurve is simply defined as ""a bow of which the string touches a section of the limb when it is strung"". To further explain this definition refer to this image: The string: as you might have guessed it's the straight, drilled cord The limb: the bent wood As you can see the string ""touches"" the wooden limb for about 3"" on the top. As soon as this happens, the bow is a recurve bow. But what about the shape?! Ah, a nice topic. One might guess that a recurve is shaped in a particular way and that's why it's a recurve. That's (surprisingly) wrong! Note: Before you read further. There are a few more details which make a ""horseman bow"" different from a ""recurve"" but that's another topic. Let's examine a so called ""horseman bow"": And now a recurve bow: Okay, besides the ""waves"" in the limbs pretty much the same, eh? But have you mentioned the tips? Horseman bow string doesn't touch the limb: Whereas a recurve's cuddles: Conclusion A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. By definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. A recurve bow stores more energy and delivers energy more efficiently than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving a greater amount of energy and speed to the arrow. A recurve will permit a shorter bow than the simple straight limb bow for a given arrow energy and this form was often preferred by archers in environments where long weapons could be cumbersome, such as in brush and forest terrain, or while on horseback.

10141,-1,What to consider before roving?,mountain-bikers,"Yes, there are a few facts to hold in mind. Roving is much fun but you really have to take care about a few points. Don't shoot where other people enjoy their free-time Never shoot towards trails, lanes, paths, tracks and so on Never shoot without a proper backstop Always use field tips Always bring your on roving target Never shoot without a spacious sight around the target Take this list just as an overview. I'll go on and describe every point a little further. Don't shoot where other people enjoy their free-time Avoid places where people frequently do free-time activities. This includes barbecue areas, swimming spots, popular stroll trails, crowded hiking trails and so on. Of course it's because of the safety. Even when you shoot from the crowd away, there is a chance that your arrow might hit something and goes uncontrollable crazy. The second thing to consider is the reputation of the sport itself. There might be people who think it's a little bit weird to stroll around with a bow and arrows. They might be worried about their children and so on. You can do two things: give them a long explanation what archery is all about or you avoid encountering them. :) Never shoot towards trails There might be people on these trails. They maybe out for a walk etc. Okay, a walking person might be slow an therefore you've time to recognize them and interrupt your shot but think about mountain-bikers. They don't see you hidden in the bushes and race straight through your ""line"". Never shoot without a proper backstop Don't shoot if nothing is behind your target. Your arrow might just fly into other people in the forest/area. You don't have enough sight to check the whole area behind the target if it's completely open. The above pictures shows a good spot. The arrows fly straight into the ground. It's extremely unlikely that they are going to be ricochets. Always use field tips Of course don't use any broadheads. You might injure wildlife if a arrow gets off. Also you damage them and your target for absolutely no reason. Spend this money on something useful like a field target :). Always bring your own roving target This is a something I see way too often (even from experienced archers). Somebody goes out in the wood and shoots on dead stumps. Nothing to worry about, right? I mean they're dead?! Yes, they are dead, but you still should be worried. Such stumps provide habitat for an enormous amount of animals, mushrooms and plants. You are decreasing this living space just because you didn't want to spend 30 bucks. A field target looks more or less like this: It's made from the same material as ""3D targets"" but can be carried around. You can hang in on a tree or place it on the floor. It's heavier and straightened on the bottom so that it doesn't roll away. You can also create your own DIY field target. Just wrap a lot of packaging tape around an old sleeping back or a crumpled bubble wrap. Never shoot without a spacious sight around the target A person collecting mushrooms, the biker, a hiker all of them can be in the forest and surprisingly well camouflaged. It's important to have a proper sight around the target so that you can't be surprised by a wild person.",mountain-bikers,0.089766271,1397,1412,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10141
10157,1,What is a bow shelf?,"the little ""cut out"" just above the grip","The Shelf The answer is really simple. It's the little ""cut out"" just above the grip. This edge where you can ""lay down"" your arrow while you shoot. A picture might help: Note: An ""arrow rest"" is something different! Design patterns Some notes on the different designs which may occur: There are 3 basic types of shelf designs; flat, radiused and ridged. The diagrams below picture these 3 variations. The radiused shelf is the most common on both longbows and recurves. As illustrated in the picture, the radius reduces the amount of arrow-to-bow contact. The flat shelf is also relatively common, especially on some older styled recurves. When a bow has this style of shelf it is necessary to use an elevated rest to get the fletching clearance necessary for good arrow flight. One trick that has been used in this situation is to place a thin narrow strip of leather under a rug rest and continue it up the sightwindow under the strike plate. This will allow more clearance and therefore help with flight. The ridged shape, I believe, is the design that offers the best clearance, since the arrow-to-bow contact is at its absolute minimum.

5345,0,What precautions are needed for caving?,"ALWAYS wear a helmet|gloves, durable kneepads","Couple things: ALWAYS wear a helmet. You bang your head a lot more than you think, since you're in the dark all the time (or with limited scope of light with your headlamp). With a helmet, you hardly feel anything when you bump your head. Much, MUCH more comfortable. Of course, keep it buckled to your head . You never know sometimes where or what will happen. THREE sources of light AND backup batteries for each. At least one source should be a headlamp. Reflective tape is great as well, especially if you're exploring - you need a way to mark your return. Always bring some of that. Perhaps most significantly, I would recommend never exploring caves without at least one very experienced person with you , who a) knows spelunking well , and b) knows the cave well . Caves are NOT good places to get lost - as it is all to easy to get search and rescue parties lost as well. Plus, there are many different variables to being lost in cave, such as no natural light (or warmth), little ventilation, etc. Oh, a mask never hurts, like a bandanna or such - I've crawled in caves with a 15"" vertical space, and you don't want to breathe bat feces or other things, it's always helpful to filter (even roughly) what you breathe. In caves that require crawling, you'll want gloves, durable kneepads (e.g. Crawldaddies or Dirty Dave's brand) and possibly elbow pads as well. If you do rock climbing or bouldering, resist the urge to do free climbs in the cave. The rock is generally in a constant process of erosion and much weaker than on above ground cliffs. Use rope on any climb that's near vertical -- and learn proper rigging (Alpine Caving Techniques is a good book about that). That's just the general stuff. As for rapelling, get comfortable with that outside first, then do it in a cave.

5846,0,What is SPF in sunscreen cream?,the time that your skin is able to protect itself from sunburn is elongated,"As it is stated in this Wikipedia article , the sun protection factor (SPF) roughly describes how the time that your skin is able to protect itself from sunburn is elongated. To take the Wikipedia example: if a person develops a sunburn in 10 minutes when not wearing a sunblock, the same person will prevent sunburn for 150 minutes if he/she wears a sunblock with a SPF of 15 So, yes, more SPF means more protection. How much protection you need depends on how intense the sun is where you are, how long you are about to stay in the sun, and how sensitive your skin is. In general one can say, that if you are somewhere with highly reflective surfaces (snow, water...) you need more protection than somewhere in a light forest. Also the higher you are, the more SPF you should take, as in higher altitudes less of the UV radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere. Therefore one cannot give a definite recommendation on what SPF you should use. Also if your skin requires an SPF of 50 or higher, you will need it ‚Äì male or not male ‚Äì and in high altitudes on a glacier you might need it.

The swell is the energy generated in the Ocean, this is ultimately what drives the waves. To generate swell you need big powerful weather systems. These typically only form in oceans. The problem with the UK is that Ireland is between us and the Ocean. So all the energy is deflected around us. this is why places like Newquay and the west coast of Scotland (as well as the west coast of Ireland) have good surf. Because they are exposed to the Atlantic swell and not the Irish sea. The break The break is the terrain that the swell hits. Different ""breaks"" generate different types and aspects of waves. A wide shallow sandy beach will generate different ""waves"" to a pointy rocky headland. You need some kind of obstruction though, something that forces the swell to rear up and form a wave. So you want the water to go from deep to shallow in a relatively short period of time. Weather Low and high pressure systems are what generate the swell.

9573,0,What should I feed ravens/crows?,meat in many forms,"We love crows! I live in America, where there are three main breeds of crow, including American Crows, Fish Crows, and Northwestern Crows . They're a bit different from the Common ravens , and other ravens, found in some other parts of the world. Although there are many varieties of each, their diets are fairly similar, so to make it easy for me, I'll call them all crows from here on! Crows are omnivores, and variety is important for their health. Their staple diet, however, is meat in many forms. Since other answers and comments have thoroughly covered that, I'll add a few other things that may work for you. Seeds and nuts: In my experience, like yours, crows don't really like bird seed, especially the small seeds we feed the songbirds. They will eat larger seeds, though, like sunflower, (which are plentiful in my yard as that's what we feed our birds year-round) and pumpkin. Crows love nuts! We feed whole, unsalted peanuts in the shell. They take one, crack it on a nearby rock, and pick out the nuts. If we try to make it easier by putting out individual nuts, they will eat them, but if we feed both, they always choose the whole. The same is true of walnuts and almonds, so there must be a desire to work for their food, which probably stems from the same instinct as pulling apart road kill. Berries and fruit: For much of the year, crows easily find berries and fruit on their own. They'll eat almost any wild food growing on trees in the woods, or on bushes or vines around your yard. Even things that are poisonous to people are fine food for crows. Some examples are poison oak, sumac, dogwood, and pokeberry. If you've invited crows into your yard, make sure to provide fruit year-round. Grapes, cherries, apples, cranberries, blueberries and figs are all good choices. Our crows won't eat anything in the citrus family, but your birds might. Grains: Our crows love dehydrated corn. We sprinkle loose kernels from a bag around the yard, and they're gone in a flash! The same corn is available on the cob . These are multi-purpose. Many of our larger birds like them, and they're a huge favorite of other backyard visitors, especially squirrels and chipmunks. I've read that crows like other grains like barley and wheat, but I haven't tried those. Miscellaneous: Our crows like whole hard-boiled eggs. We take the shells off, but it's probably not necessary. Crows also eat a variety of things that wash up on the beach. I wonder what the fish-equivalent name is to road kill. Maybe ocean kill?! You could try putting out dishes of fish carcass and leftover raw shellfish, but I haven't done it. Backyard: Lots of living things in the yard appeal to crows, including insects, worms, spiders and small animals like frogs. Contrary to what some people say, crows can benefit the yard, as they eat the types of grubs and insects that endanger plants and food crops. They do eat some rodents, small birds, and nest eggs, but if we keep the crows well-fed, our other creatures are safer than we think. As @michael mentioned, crows are very intelligent, and ravens even moreso. They're also quite sociable, and are content to let you sit nearby while they wander around the yard. A friend of mine in Florida has a crow that will take a nut or hunk of meat right out of her hand. Establishing a relationship like that takes time, but is well worth it! As for being noisy while they eat, I haven't found that to be true. They may squawk when they're hungry, but they seem to make more noise in the trees than on the lawn, or at the feeding areas in our yard. I happen to love the sound, but I love all animal sounds, so I might not be the right one to give you an opinion! Ravens seem to have a wider variety of calls than crows, some being less ear-piercing and more tolerable. The diet we use was chosen from a number of sources, and customized by trial and error. The sources include, but are not limited to: Cornell Lab of Ornithology How to Attract Crows to Your Backyard The Language of Crows Audubon Bird Guide I hope things that have worked for us will help you.

This species is however; highly variable in color and anatomical features such as body.‚Äù",medium sized cichlid,0.159515202,150,170,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18551
21315,1,What counts as climbing a mountain?,"a summit, a high point","As a peakbagger, I often have that sort of conversation. First you need to define your terms. What constitutes a mountain, a summit, a high point - all those matter. I have ""climbed"" high points in farm fields that are on such flat areas that we can't even know for certain where it's actually highest. That's why I'm very bored by the idea of county or state highpointing. Ignoring anthropogenic borders and using physical attributes of summits makes much more sense to me. One interesting way to truly climb a mountain that I have tried is to go for a sea-to-summit climb. This is easier on coastal peaks. For example if we're sailing somewhere, I always try to summit any island we anchor near to. That ensures I climbed all possible elevation gain. There are crazy endeavours in sea-to-summit climbs, like doing Hawaiian island summits from the coast or climbing Mount Fairweather which rises straight out of the Pacific Ocean (that would be an insane trip). Generally this is out of the realm of practicality for most people so even flying in on the glaciers two thirds of the way to the summit will count as an ascent. The usual benchmark is to start from the surrounding valleys. For a classic mountain that rises from every side, this is usually where the trailheads are and no one would deny counting an ascent from there.","a summit, a high point",0.054042336,123,145,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21315

Illness and deaths have resulted from eating this fungus, although some people can tolerate them. Found very early in the season. Can become very large. Sometimes known as red morels, red mushrooms, elephant ears or brain mushrooms. Often found around rotted oak tree stumps. Gyromitra esculenta is one of several common species of false morels found in the spring about the same time as the true morels . It is also sometimes known as the beefsteak morel, or the lorchel. The Gyromitra species are Ascomycota that superficially resemble the Morels (Morchella esculenta, M. elata and related species). They can be found in roughly the same areas as the true morels and the two genera often grow in close proximity to one another. In our area we usually find false morels rather close to fallen logs, where a microniche of moisture, humidity, and shade is likely to be found, but there is quite a bit of variability in their habitat. True morels are considered to be delicious and one of the most sought after of the edible fungi. False morels should be considered to be poisonous and should probably not be eaten in most parts of the world. I'll tell you more about this below. Fortunately true morels and false morels are relatively easy to distinguish from one another.

Never continue to go further assuming there is going to be a sign just up ahead. You may be right, however the risk of getting lost and something unfortunate happening is too great. If you become separated or lost, many experts suggest staying put (assuming someone knows you were out there).

Making color contrasting flags provides good source of unnatural color and movement. A universal distress signal is 3 flags or 3 triangles. If you determine your best course of action is to move on, always leave some signal to indicate the direction your are headed. That way if someone finds where you were, they know the direction to look for you in.

The fluidity, the rise and fall, the total compression and release of the spring of your legs comes as close to flying as one can get and still be attached (at least part of the time) to the ground. More stable knees : from personal experience, since I started telemark, the knee pain I experienced chronically as an alpine skier has completely disappeared. I assume this is since my knees are bent in a position of stability, and my center of gravity is closer to the ski and ground during the hard-torque carving of a turn. More athletic way to ski : since you are essentially doing lunges down the mountain, your thighs, hamstrings, glutes, and core get an amazing workout. A new challenge : For me, after decades of alpine skiing, telemark offered (and continues to offer) a new challenge.

Repair Contact the manufacturer or a retailer that sells that brand. There is a good chance they might fix them under warranty. I've had many good experiences with getting older equipment that you think might not be covered taken care of, but each brand varies on how far they'll go. It sometimes helps to go through a retailer to get warranty service. The wide-mouth capped bladder may be compatible with a standard Nalgene-style lid , so if that's the one that only has a bad cap then try looking into that.

The cost of such adhesive would money better spent by putting it towards buying a new bladder. If the rip is due to age, then the bladder will most likely rip again in another spot soon after repairing, so it really isn't worth trying to fix it at all. Reuse If all repair options are exhausted, you could use the outer insulating sleeve. Remove the old inner bladder if possible along with any extraneous parts such as caps or hose nibs, and simply slide in a new bladder with its own cap and hose coming out through a hole in the sleeve. You may have to cut open the old bladder to accomplish this and customize the old bladder sleeve to fit the new one. If the outer sleeve has backpack straps, you could modify it be a very small daypack or cycling pack. Again this would involve some cutting and probably some sewing to achieve the end result.

However, there is a group at Harvard that does research on barefoot running, and they have a web page with a lot of good information on it. As far as I've seen from browsing through their materials casually, it seems like one argument in favour of barefoot running is the following: When you get injured, it isn't just the amount of force that determines the damage, but also the rate at which the force changes, i.e., how ""jerky"" it is. If you know calculus, this is a statement that the third derivative of the position with respect to time is important. This is pretty well understood for machines, and probably applies to the human body as well. For example, a machine like a mill or a lathe can be damaged by vibration, and you can't make the machine vibrate by using a steady force, only by using a force that changes rapidly. The Harvard group has data showing that shod runners have more ""jerky"" impact with the ground and, like machines, are more prone to vibration damage or injury. There is also evidence that the factors you'd think would affect injury, such as cushioning and distance, actually don't have much effect, because people subconsciously adjust their bodies.

5995,-2,What is a tour book used for?,to see if someone is totally unprepared for the planned expedition,"First of all I have to admit that the following is mostly not based on knowledge but more or less on educated guessing, so take it with a grain of salt. Alpine tours Let's first consider hiring a guide in the Alps (maximum height below 5000m). Here the answer, if you will be asked for a tour book should be in nearly all cases ""No"". Here we can just divide the tours into two categories, based on how risky they are for the guide. In the ""easy"" category we can put all tours where the guide could easily go alone as well and just has to take additional care to guarantee for the safety of their guest. The normal routes onto most four-thousander peaks in the Alps will be in this category for example. Here a guide will quite surely not ask for a tour book as they will able to bring you there as long as you are physically and mentally fit enough, as the guide will be able to handle all the technical stuff. The ""hard"" category are routes that put also the guide at significant risk and where the guest is not only a passive factor in the safety consideration but has to actively perform tasks such as belaying. Here the guide might ask for a tour book but will ask at least, what you have done before to get an estimation what you are able to do. In this class you surely also won't do a ""let's meet in the morning and rush up that dangerous route"" like tour, unless you have been on tour with this guide before. So typically you will be together with that guide over several days and do some easier tours before for acclimatisation and to get to know each other. For all alpine tours there is also one big advantage: You are not far from civilization and there's not much planning and organization required in advance. Typically you also are on tour in small groups of maybe a maximum of five people or so. Therefore, if your guide sees that you are not well enough prepared for the tour, you can just cancel and return to base without greater financial or organizational costs. Expeditions For expeditions, things are bit different as there has to be lot of organization beforehand: flights and transportation have to be booked, a time schedule for the approach to the target mountains is made and there are a lot of people involved. In this case, a single person that is unable to cope with the requirements might make the whole expedition fail. You cannot just turn around and walk back to the airport if you are on tour with a 20 person expedition in a remote area. In this case, the guides in charge will surely want to know if the people they are taking with them will be most likely be able to meet all the requirements for the tour. I know of at least one case, where the guide in charge of a commercial Mount Everest expedition cancelled the whole expedition as he recognized that none of the participants had ever been above 8000m before. How and what to write into a tour book? I surfed the websites and catalogs of some expedition organizers but none of them gave some explicit information on what they expect from a tour book. However, I would not spend too much thoughts on that problem as the organizers cannot expect that someone will write such a book just to comply with the requirements of a expedition organizer. So I would just keep some kind of ""log"" of my activities. Things I would note are: peak route group members weather and tour conditions starting time, time when crucial points (peaks, passes etc., entries to climbing routes) were reached, tour end time special occurrences, especially when they significantly influenced the time needed for the tour Some hard facts like photos or stamps from the huts where you slept will increase authenticity but are more or less optional. I also would not care too much that they will stalk your tour partners to get information about you. I guess they will ask for the tour books before or at the first planning meetings to see if someone is totally unprepared for the planned expedition. If in doubt, they will ask you and make their own picture of you. A good guide should be able to tell if you are mostly honest about the tours you did or you are just a dazzler. For the case that they were wrong they normally have a clause in their terms and conditions that allows them to exclude you from the the peak ascent and stay in base camp. I guess that is a shame no serious mountaineer wants to go through.",to see if someone is totally unprepared for the planned expedition,0.303973377,3896,3962,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5995

These typically should be used in case you are planning for a run or a trail-run. These are less comfortable as compared to Comfort Insoles. These typically features arch support. This help with Overpronation problems as well, and I found them more useful for someone like me who has an odd size of feet that doesn't fit in a standard shoe size. The arch part of the insole helped me with problem that I faced that in my shoes the feet slips forward when I run, causing a toe pain, worst case sometimes a black toe, just because I had a bigger size of a shoe than what suits me. Heel Pads There is another thing called Heel pads. There are used to lift your heel slightly higher than what a normal insole would do. These are typically meant to reduce the discomfort with Heel injuries. I have never tried them at all. Metatarsal Pads : This type of insoles is designed to decrease the pressure on the metatarsal bones. They fit under the balls of the feet and are recommended for athletes who often run uphill or experience pain in their mid-foot. These never made any sense to me but I have seen so many people using them for ascends and removing them on a descend. May be this idea of taking off shoes just for that matter never made sense to me. In general, I were you, I would look for insoles that offer a higher arch to hold the heel in place which will help in supporting the leg and keeping it steady rather than having the entire pressure slipped to toe on a descend.

10452,,What are the different stages of frostbite?,hypothermia,"First I will describe the stages of frostbite focusing on how to detect them and what are the implications of each. Secondly I will address handling frostbite. Classification Stages of frostbite are divided into two classes: Damage to the skin (first and second stage) and damage including deeper tissue (nerves, muscles, tendons) (third and fourth stage). First Stage The skins gets white-marbled and becomes increasingly numb. Used areas like feet often hurt before getting numb, while e.g. the face can get numb without initial pain. After complete (!) recovery there is no lasting damage apart from an increased susceptibility of the tissue to frostbite. Second Stage In the field this is very often indistinguishable from first stage frostbite. The skin is certainly white and numb, but blisters do not necessarily appear quickly. They often develop after rewarming the tissue. The liquid in the blisters is clear. This can lead to permanently altered sensation in the affected tissue. Third Stage The liquid in the blisters contains blood and the surrounding tissue is reddened. Now deep tissue is involved and there will be permanent damage. Its extent can only be judged after days. Fourth Stage This is the stadium in which cell death and thus necrosis occurs. Tissue will be lost. Frostbite First-Aid In the field Most important is early detection of frostbite. Be vigilant for signs and most importantly, do not ignore them. As there is no or decreasing pain involved it is easy to just go on for the summit. When frostbite is detected, a judgment call has to be maid: In the current location and considering the way ahead, is it realistically possible to rewarm the affected area without danger hypothermia and can repeated frostbite be averted. Only if both is given you should try to rewarm in the field. Repeated frostbite will damage tissue for sure, never rewarm unless repeated frostbite can be surely prohibited . The affected area can be considered successfully rewarmed if within 10 minutes the tissue is well perfused and the numbness has completely disappeared. If these conditions are not given or the attempt to rewarm failed you need to get to the closest shelter. Ideally the affected area should be immobilized, so if it is a foot the patient should not go on its own but be transported. Often this is not possible or much slower so that further frostbite or hypothermia would occur, so the patient goes on its own anyway. Rewarming After Reaching Shelter Never rub the area in snow, this does more damage than help. Anyway the area has to be protected from mechanical injuries. To rewarm a water bath with a temperature of just slightly above body temperature (40degC) should be used. Ideally with some drops of iodine in it. This bath should not last longer than 30 minutes, otherwise the skin will be weakened and germs can enter. Give the patient enough to drink. While the pain during rewarming is a good sign (nerves still intact), it is very intense. Pain medication should be given, often strong ones are needed. While acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) should in general not be used as pain medication in outdoor activities, in this case its inhibition of platelets can increase blood flow and thus help diffusing the affected area. After rewarming the tissue the stage becomes clear. First stage frostbite will present without visible change in the area. It may still be second stage frostbite and blisters will develop later, so further observation is needed. All higher stages need to be treated similarly to wounds, as the primary concern is infection. So wrap it in sterile dressing. For second stage it depends on the progression whether a doctor should be seen. If pain raises, the area shows signs of infections or the blisters do not heal well, you should see a doctor. Higher stages have to be presented to a doctor at the earliest stage possible. In these cases gangrene can form (the tissue becomes black and completely numb) which will result in tissue loss, but nowadays is not amputated immediately unless there is infection of the surrounding tissue (the body separates the dead tissue by itself).

10891,,What respirator should I get for urbex?,P100,"I searched deep into the ""interwebs"" and this is the best answer I could get. It's from UER , one of the biggest online urbex communities. Differences between respirators Respirators are masks that use filters to clean the air before it is breathed. Don't confuse respirators with standard dust masks, the kind that looks like bra cups. True respirators have a rubber boot to form a good seal with your face and check valves to positively isolate exhale and inhale path. Respirators with P100 rated particulate filters are recommended if you're going to a location that contains a significant amount of nuisance dust, rat urine laced dust, aerosols or asbestos. P100 filters hold indefinitely and you can use them until they get dirty, wet, or becomes noticeably harder to breath in. Since N95 is ineffective against asbestos, you should insist on P100. If your location contains organic vapors,acid gases, mercury vapor among other things, you need some activated carbon cartridges designed for the type of contaminant. Since it's uneconomical to stock on each type, I would get a set of Multi-vapor/Multi gas type. THESE HAVE A VERY LIMITED LIFE ONCE OPENED. They have expiration dates and once opened, they should be stored in sealed bags, like ZipLoc. After a few months, they should be considered ineffective. Higher the contaminant exposure, the sooner the cartridges will saturate. Read the enclosed manual. If you think you spent the useful life, throw them out and consider these one or two time use items. NIOSH rating This information was what I was looking for and helps me understand what mask to use in each situation: Filters are given a NIOSH rating based on two factors: their effectiveness against oil-based hazards, and their efficiency. The rating consists of a letter followed by a number. These break down as follows: ""N-"" - Not resistant to oils. ""R-"" - Resistant to oils. ""P-"" - oil-Proof. ""-95"" - Able to filter out 95% of dangerous substances. ""-99"" - Able to filter out 99% of dangerous substances. ""-100"" - Able to filter out 99.97% of dangerous substances. Therefore, N95 filters provide the least protection among the NIOSH-approved respirators, and P100 filters provide the greatest protection. It is of paramount importance that you know the capabilities and limitations of your respirator. No respirator creates oxygen; even the best filter will not cut it if there is less than 19.6% oxygen in the environment. No respirator will protect you against hydrogen sulfide - though the better ones will give you a longer ""grace period"" in which to escape. A filter which has been used against mercury loses its effectiveness against chlorine, and vice versa. For most situations, it is recommended that you carry a P100 with cartridges that are effective against, at the very least, organic vapors, aerosols, asbestos, and oils. Sizing There is also (in the same article) a good point about sizing. It says basically the same thing as @Mr.Wizard in his answer, that if the mask doesn't form a good seal, it's worthless. Actually: (...) According to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Adm.) standards workers need to be fit tested for these before they actually use them. (...) Buying respirators Just a final note, after reading this it was easy to find websites selling P100 masks. Well, some of them looked like regular ""surgical masks"" with a filter on the front, but it was pretty obvious you wouldn't get a good seal. I will go for a ""real"" P100 respirator, which always have pink-colored filters. There's a lot of different brands, sizes, prices and formats available. Thanks guys for the answers you provided. I found this info based on what you told me. Cheers.

11069,,What are good indicators of hail approaching?,location,"In order to distinguish hail from a thunderstorm you should know how the temperature is decreasing with altitude. Generally if it decreases really fast you have formation of hail. (Edit: you mentioned dew point, this is where condensation of warm hair happens, freezing level is not the same thing and it will be located somewhere higher than the dew point. Knowing the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate and the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate is necessary to find cloudbase and freezing level. Im not sure how much in depth you want to go with these things so I will let you do the research on it. A pilot course booklet will have a simple explanation of the whole thing) Where I'm from this happens and hail is fairly common in certain periods of the year, so season becomes one of the indications in those cases. Dry air at a certain altitude will lower the freezing level in the atmosphere, a lower freezing level means that eventual hail wont have the time to melt into drops like it would if it had to fall longer through a warmer air layer. For the same reason places at higher altitudes would be closer to the normal freezing level. I don't think you can know how dry is the air at a certain altitude with a simple weather station that gets datas only from ground level. What you know, though, is that certain places tend to often have this dry middle layer and so location becomes an indicator for you as those are informations you can find. Wind , higher up, that you can more or less tell from looking at the clouds before the event and around (movement and plumes). In a thunderstorm you have strong updrafts and downdrafts, if vertical and in all directions (that, I guess, you would know collecting live datas from various weather stations in the region if you want to use want to use only simple datas) you tend to have a short or failed thunderstorm but if there is high wind higher up (speed wind shear where higher altitude winds are much faster than ground levels) you find that it can push the updraft sideways (updraft and downdraft will form a sort of Œõ ) so that the feed of warmer hair is maintained and the updraft speed (Upward Vertical Velocity, if you want to look it up on your own) will be high and hail and violent thunderstorms (or worse) can result between updraft and downdraft. Also, where I'm from, farmers look at storm clouds approaching and if these present lighter streaks they know hail is coming (and you used to start hearing hail cannons). For this reasons clouds become another indication, with short notice though. Once I started paragliding, skydiving and kayaking weather forecast and satellite datas became much more important and reliable than anything else to figure out possibilities of hail storms much earlier. So if where you live the weather is so unpredictable to not match anything above there wont be much simple datas you can collect yourself at ground level that will give much notice. If you want to collect weather informations available on the net to make your own forecasts you obviously can, learning a bit of meteorology, but at that point you find the forecasts already prepared for you and probably more reliable.

For foraging in the British Isles, one classic work (and a personal favourite of mine) is Richard Mabey's Food for Free (originally published 1972 and never out of print since). The introduction explains the book's remit: This book covers the majority of wild plant food products which can be obtained in the British Isles. But there are some categories which I have deliberately omitted. There is nothing on grasses and cereals. This is intended to be a practical book, and no one is going to spend their time hand-gathering enough wild seeds to make Ô¨Çour. I have touched brieÔ¨Çy on the traditional herbal uses of many plants where this is relevant or interesting. But I have included no plants purely on the grounds of their presumed therapeutic value. This is a book about food, not medicine. This is also a book about wild plant foods, which is the simple reason (apart from personal qualms) why there is nothing about Ô¨Åsh and wildfowl. But I have included shellÔ¨Åsh because from a picker‚Äôs eye view, they are more like plants than animals. They stay more or less in one place, and are gathered, not caught. Apart from the omissions listed above, the book covers edible plants and fungi pretty comprehensively, including seaweed. It's available in a portable Collins Gem edition in case you want to take it with you. Certainly there are fish in the rivers too, and other edible animals on land -- that would be another book-length answer.

That would increase the likelyhood that they are crayfish burrows.

Each one has a crawfish living in a burrow below. Water-filled tunnels can extend down three feet or more sometimes straight down, but usually with some side tunnels and a room at the end. Sometimes the color and texture of a chimney mud is different at different levels as the crawfish brings up soil from different layers to deposit the pellets on the surface. They use their legs and mouth parts to dig up mud and make into a little ball or pellet. Pellets are built on the surface like a brick layers putting bricks on a wall.

15100,-1,What could possibly go wrong in Sarek?,There are no marked trails,"I have hiked the entirety of the Kungsleden, did an 11 day Sarek crossing and have also been on parts of the Nordkalottleden and the Padjelantaleden - so you could say I am fairly experienced with northern Scandinavian mountain treks. Kungsleden I did Kungsleden in 2006 - 'crowded' meant for us that we maybe saw some 5 groups of people per day, sharing camp grounds around the huts with maybe some 5 parties each night. That was on the northernmost section (Abisko southwards), which is also the most popular one. In 2018 I was again hiking parts of the northernmost Kungsleden sections again, we met maybe 10-20 parties per day, with some avg. of maybe 10-30 people camping at the huts. If you go towards the south, i.e. Kvikkjok/Ammern√§s, it gets far less crowded, most days we maybe met some 1-2 groups of hikers. But: Kungsleden remains very very beautiful, it is easy to reach and with all the huts if something goes wrong help is never too far ( i.e. maybe half a days walk ). Also, while expensive, you can resupply at the huts and mountain stations, meaning that you don't need to carry as much food if you don't want to (food is heavy :P). Sarek Sarek on the other hand is quite another experience! There are no marked trails, in some areas there are no trails what so ever. There are no bridges, so expect to do all your river-crossings (of which there can be many) the hard-core way by fording/wading through. Most importantly, except for the one emergency phone cabin in the center of Sarek, it is completely empty . You will have to bring food for the entire trek, which will take you at least a week, potentially a lot longer (we attempted to cross Sarek on an 11 day route). Note that you will have to bring plenty of reserves too, as the weather can make short work of your nicely laid out plans: when our group attempted a crossing, a sudden thunderstorm let the rivers swell high enough to cut of some valleys which forced us to completely change our route. If something goes wrong , the nearest place to call for help might be a 3 day hike from where you are, depending on your location. You must be aware of this fact and plan for it: if somebody is injured at least one person must stay with the injured one, while someone (better even two) go and fetch help. What can go wrong? In terms of what can actually happen I'd say the dangers are pretty similar on Kungsleden vs. Sarek - with some added risks due to all the river crossings you'll have to do in Sarek (Kungsleden has bridges). Anything from twisted ankles to broken legs or worse Hypothermia b/c of a combination of bad weather/bad preparation/bad decision making Getting sick midway River crossing by wading (if you do not know the dangers don't even think about Sarek) ... --> Sarek is not per se more dangerous (except for river crossings), but it is a lot more remote . If something happens, getting help will thus be a lot harder than on the Kungsleden. Just imagine having to sit and wait for 2 or 3 days with a broken leg until your friend hopefully made it far enough to alert emergency responders... Bottom line... If, as you say, your group is rather inexperienced, I strongly suggest you stick to Kungsleden. Once you have a couple of weeks experience in Scandinavian mountain treks behind your belt Sarek can be a wonderful and challenging adventure - but this is not something for beginners.",There are no marked trails,0.092321396,1210,1236,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15100

With Horse Boarding you are pulled along by a horse and rider. This gives added complexity - one because you're doubling (tripling if you include the horse) the number of participants. It is considered an extreme sport in a similar way to 3 day eventing (people die doing cross country where jumps go wrong). The idea being to run a course at the fastest time with least faults - same as all horse events, lowest score wins. DESCRIPTION OF ARENA BOARDING 8.1 Teams compete against the clock around a course defined by a series of gates and obstacles. 8.2 The course comprises a series of gates that should be 4 m wide, other obstacles, and designated Start and Finish. 8.3 Teams wait in a collecting or pits area, and enter the main part of the arena when called by the pits officials. 8.4 The competition comprises runs over Course A and Course B. Course B is the reverse of Course A. Full rules below as there are a lot! It is international! Horseboarding International has been set up by Horseboarding UK to promote and develop the sport of horseboarding worldwide.

16583,-1,What type of fishing lure is this?,a type of plug,"Unless there is a certain terminology for ""backside"" plugs, this is a plug (or as I know it: a wobbler. No idea which term is more commonly used around where you live). Wikipedia Link I had to bust out my detective hat and pipe to find information on these ones, but I stumbled upon this: an article about this bait They are(?)/were made by bomber, and nowadays you find them as Arbogast Mudbugs . (Note the two notches vs one notch in the bomber) Now on to plugs as I understand you question being for plugs in general, not your bait specificly. There are some different types, some with shovel, some without. The ones without shovel usually sink, and depend on you to perform, you twitch your rod and work the bait to make it ""jump"" through the water like an injured fish. With some skill you can walk it through the water impressively (you make make it do sharp 90 or even 180 degree turns). But I don't want to focus on these baits, lets focus on the baits with this ""shovel"". The shovel can determine how deep your lure runs at certain reeling speeds. These lures typically float (or suspend in the water), and only start to dive once you start reeling them in. You can make it more attractive by adding some twitches again, sometimes you even have to. But usually it ""wobbles"" from side to side, which attracts fish. To answer your questions specifically: This is a type of plug, you find some more information above You use them to catch predatory fish. Depending on the action you can just cast-and-reel these baits, adding some more action yourself. Depending on the baits action, you will use reel-speed to get it to your preferred depth, and then slow down and start working your bait. You reel slowly, you stop and let the lure rise to the top, then you start reeling again to make it dive. Or you just reel at a constant speed. Plugs have a diving depth at which they don't dive much deeper. You are constantly pulling it upwards, and the shovel pulls it downwards, at some point you will reach a balance. You will catch predatory fish with it. It it eats living fish, you catch it. I even had birds attack wobblers of mine. On why this lure seems to perform so much better than other, modern lures: Chances are that it doesn't. You were successful with it and use it again, thus you remain successful with it. The most successful lures are usually ... wet. You use them, you catch fish with them. Since this lure seems to be more uncommon than most modern lures, it might acutally have an advantage as fish might be less timid towards it. All those shiny, rattling, loud lures in the water, and suddenly there is a lot of movement amongst fish, as you catch one of them, chances are that this stress makes fish avoid these new types of lures. On the other hand, they still catch fish, so who knows... So who knows why your lure might be more successful. Fish don't know it yet? It looks like some type of familiar food to them? You were lucky? The lure just performs better than modern ones? Maybe it just has the perfect diving depth for your lake, or it dives at a speed that perfectly passes each water depth, aiding in finding fish. I can only speculate at this point.

18672,-1,What is an effective technique for plogging?,to make a difference,"I suggest the first step is to go for the light, grabbable stuff - plastic bottles for example. The contents, if any, can be poured onto the ground. This assumes your roadside example, which is likely to be so polluted that pouring out a bit of sugary water (or even urine, found in bottles by the side of the road surprisingly often) will be environmentally OK. You may not want to do this on a trail. In fact if you specialise, you can recycle easily - plastic bottles in one trip, cans the next, etc. Something big enough to pick up easily with one hand, on clear ground, can be grabbed without breaking step though it will take some practice. I could not find a video, but Rugby Coach Weekly describes the technique, which I remember from my school days. My understanding of plogging is that the goal isn't to get every last scrap, but to make a difference. Wear gloves, waterproof and tough. Pictures I've seen do show people jogging with two bags, which would improve the balance but make picking things up harder. I suggest one bag, changing hands occasionally. With an out and back route or a regular loop run in alternating directions you can run out quite fast and empty handed, and come back more slowly.

The lenses are made of a prism-shaped glass that bends the light in such a way that you see what is happening up while looking straight in front of you. They help to avoid neck pain, and they also make it easier to always keep an eye on the climber. So in theory the glasses are a great idea for people who climb often, or have to belay for a long time, or have problems with their neck. I see a lot of old folks wearing them, so might be especially appealing for older people. I believe the main reason those glasses are not that popular is that they used to be really expensive. I remember them costing around 200 euros a few years ago. I have also tried belay glasses myself. And while most of my friends who have tried them really liked them, I couldn't stay for longer than a couple of minutes while wearing those glasses myself. Of course, it might be a matter of getting used to the feeling, but I was getting dizzy, and decided it was better for the climber if I took those glasses off. So my verdict would be that in theory the belay glasses sound like a great idea, and most people seem to like them well enough, but you should try them out yourself before deciding to buy.

In those ecosystems bats are the only creatures leaving the deep dark regions of the caves and returning each day. When they're out at night they fill their bellies, and when they're hanging out during the day they're dropping their guano to the ground where many creepy crawlies pick through it, sustaining thriving populations.

20411,-1,What are lawful wilderness activities in Canada?,camping,"In Ontario, the relevant terminology is ""Crown Land"". This is land that is not owned by any private entity, and is essentially free for use, however there are some rules. Most of the province is crown land, and from Ottawa you can access it quite readily. With regards to fishing, fishing in any body of water (Except privately owned/stocked facilities) requires a fishing license. These are very cheap (under $20 a year for a ""conservation"" license) and include rules about what species can be harvested and in what quantities. The province is broken into regions and the rules may vary between regions. All of this information is easily available from whereever you obtain your license. You can do so online, but might prefer to hit a local fishing shop in Ottawa or the region you will be fishing in to chat and get some local knowledge. For camping, I believe you can camp anywhere on crown land, but there may be set-back requirements from roads. I am not sure about cutting of trees to build a shelter, I believe any structure must be temporary in nature, a simple wood cabin may be still be considered permanent. However, realistically any action of enforcement is going to be complaint based. If your activities aren't extreme and aren't bothering anyone, you could easily get away with building a simple structure.

21713,-1,What is a cartridge‚Äôs point-blank-range?,the bullet should hit at the bottom of its vital zone,"As the answer to the question about flatter shooting cartridges states: ""you don't have to get the range to the animal as accurately because the bullet is dropping less"" . The concept underlying this is the point-blank range , which is the theoretical maximum range at which you can hold directly on target (ie not adjust for range) and still hit it. Your line of sight through a scope or iron sights is a straight line but the bullet follows a ballistic trajectory . This means that the bullet moves above and below your line of sight as it travels downrange: [ source ] In order to hit a target dead on, you must know both its range and how your bullet travels after it leaves the barrel (its external ballistics . This is certainly possible, but takes a non-negligible amount of knowledge and time. For hunters, though, you don't necessarily need to be driving tacks with every shot. This is because there are many areas on a deer, for example, in which a hit will be lethal: [ source ] If the vital zone (the heart and lungs) of a deer is an 8"" diameter circle, you can aim in the centre of it and, even if your bullet lands 4"" above or below your point of aim, you will still have a lethal shot. [ source ] So, in this example, the point blank range will be the range at which the bullet does not travel above or below the line of sight by more than 4 inches. Let's look at two different cartidges: a 250 gr. 45-70 Gov't and a 180 gr. 300 Win Mag (I'm not trying to advertise for Hornady, they just include some ballistic information on their website). ShootersCalculator is a good resource for calculating bullet trajectories and point-blank ranges. Taking a look at the trajectories of the bullets when zeroed at 200 yards, the 300 Win Mag is clearly flatter shooting: What does this mean for point blank range? The PBR for the 45-70 is 211 yards with a zero at 181 yards whereas for the 300 Win Mag it is 325 yards with a zero at 277 yards . This means that you can theoretically lethally hit an 8"" target at a much further range with the 300 Win Mag without having to compensate for range to target or the external ballistics of the bullet. All of that said, I don't recommend taking shots without some kind of range compensation. If you aim at the centre of a target at point-blank range, the bullet should hit at the bottom of its vital zone, but this would only occur in a perfect world. In reality, many sources of error are introduced, including the intrinsic accuracy of the rifle and ammunition combination, the ability of the shooter, the natural variation in targets, etc. In my opinion, we should all try and have the bullet hit the target where we want it to, and thus knowing the external ballistics of your bullet is more important than knowing the point-blank range.",the bullet should hit at the bottom of its vital zone,0.399042577,2299,2352,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21713

The one glaring point in this belay (to me at least) is that the carabiners are both clipped into the central belay loop . Ideally these should be clipped off individually onto the loop of each figure of eight. In this photo, the belay loop is a single point of failure, this is unnecessary, using the rope loops allows the addition of extra redundancy into the system: So the large HMS carabiner should be clipped into the loop behind the figure eight of the red rope: And the smaller crab should be clipped into the knot loop of the blue rope: Both ropes are then totally independent. Any failure at any point would result in a backup, e.g.: red rope fails, blue is totally isolated blue fails, red is isolated belay loop not used so is no longer a single failure point Any individual (or as this is a 3 point system it'll take 2 failures) anchor failure is backed up",the carabiners are both clipped into the central belay loop,0.175529778,419,478,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21877
22618,0,What to look for in climbing shoes?,"Climbing shoes must sit tightly on your foot, but they must not hurt","Even though you say cost is not a primary factor, I still think it's good to be aware of this point when buying your first climbing shoes when mainly used in gyms (I wasn't aware at the time :) ): This won't be your last pair of climbing shoes, you'll need new ones quite soon due to the sole wearing through. Therefore you don't need to get the perfect technical climbing shoe on your first purchase. You can resole, but the price differences is not so high to buying a new one, so if the shoes aren't a great fit, you can just switch then (well price-difference depends on location probably, but still). Fitting your feet is key Climbing shoes must sit tightly on your foot, but they must not hurt. There's zero advantage in using tiny shoes at beginner level and in my opinion even at expert level it depends a lot on the type of climb and is often hyped up way too much. Both sizing and fit vary greatly between different brands, and also within brands. Don't be irritated if you need to try models with hugely different sizings. Neutral profile Climbing shoes are often pointed toward the front and have a concave form both length-wise and side-ways. You don't need any of these features in the beginning. If you feel comfortable with models that have such features, go with it, but don't limit your options due to them. Sole thickness There's a trend towards thinner soles. The standard was/is I think 5mm, and now they go down to 3mm to give you ""a better feel of the footholds"". That means your soles will also wear through faster. Material Models made of leather will adapt to your foot. At the end of their lifetime, they may feel totally comfortable. Synthetic materials may have a little stretch, but they generally don't adapt to your feet over time. So with leather you can expect shoes to get more comfortable after wearing them a few times, with synthetics not so much. For bouldering prefer soft over hard Especially for outdoors climbing soles can be quit rigid. For bouldering being able to move your feet in almost any direction is a good thing. Specialist bouldering models might even have completely separate soles for the front and back of the foot for more flexibility.",quit rigid,0.065171897,1969,1979,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22618

20308,1,"What group of people call themselves ""Outdoor Influencers"", and what do they do regarding natural areas of land?",raise awareness for important causes to protect these lands,"Basically it's people with large social media followings who use their influence on those platforms, especially Instagram, to influence people to visit outdoor places, buy outdoor things and support outdoor causes. Their Instagrams of beautiful vistas have brought attention to environmental issues ‚Äî and foot traffic to unspoiled wilderness. According to How the rise of Outdoor Influencers is Affecting the Environment : Outdoor influencers are a relatively new phenomenon, and their rise is largely attributable to Instagram. Adam Buchanan, who started the first influencer marketing program at Columbia Sportswear, says he thought of the idea while camping in the La Plata Mountains in Southern Colorado. It looks like most of the complaints come from them posting pictures with geotags and then massive herds of people showing up to those locations to take the same picture. These people are afraid that all the attention will draw too many people to areas that are not able to handle the extra traffic without sacrificing the integrity and privacy. From the same source : On the one hand, there‚Äôs the notion that posting content on the outdoors inspires others to get outside (see: #OptOutside, et al.). On the other, there‚Äôs the very real fear that posting photos of hidden hikes and hot springs invites an influx of visitors these places lack the resources to handle. Geotagging can also get specific, and that‚Äôs where the real issues start. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a lot of problems with people geotagging hidden or sensitive places,‚Äù Bou√© said, adding that these places don‚Äôt always have the infrastructure to handle a lot of new visitors. Its sort of how the story of the man who had to cut his arm off brought more users to that specific canyon. Except for Ralston himself, Utah officials hadn‚Äôt performed a single rescue in Blue John or the surrounding canyons between 1998 and 2005. But after Ralston published a book about his ordeal in late 2004, and especially since last January‚Äôs release of 127 Hours, starring James Franco as Ralston, the canyon has seen a jump in rescues. Since June 2005, more than two dozen hikers have been reported missing in or near Blue John. Most of them, like Richards, were trying to retrace Ralston‚Äôs route. Tourist Trap The part that people seem to feel positive about is when the Outdoor Influencers use their platforms to raise awareness for important causes to protect these lands. Kate Boue, who was one of the first to be coined an Outdoor Influencer, has said that they have a social responsibility to use their Instagram power for good, meaning to help protect the land, so we can enjoy it more.

No one method is really perfect at removing everything, so I usually use a two-stage approach: Filter : If the water source is cloudy, your first step should be to remove the larger impurities. You can buy expensive pump filters for this, or you can just pour the water through a sock, bandanna, or any other tightly-woven fabric to remove the larger stuff. Note that you can probably skip this step if the water you're collecting is clear and fast-moving. Boil : Heat sterilization is really the only sure-fire way to kill bacteria, viruses and other undesirable microbial life in your water. It's a commonly used technique to clean medical instruments since it's so effective. It does require a heat source, and it'll take some time to get a full rolling boil. But if you're at all worried about the quality of your water, it's your safest bet. Edit: As commenters noted, if you're in an area with potential chemical pollutants or metals in the water, you should filter even if the water appears clear.

29,1,What are the different methods to purify water?,Bringing the water up to boiling point,"Boiling- 185¬∞F (85¬∞C) water will become sterile in minutes. Bringing the water up to boiling point will typically sterilize it. At high altitude you may need to boil for a minute. Chemical- Iodine, chlorine, and other chemicals can sterilize water. Follow directions on products specifically designed for this purpose. Typically you'll need to mix it and then let it sit for some number of minutes. Although chemicals are required, this method is often the most convenient as carrying a few pills is simple. If chlorine scares you, consider that you have been drinking it your whole life in tap water. Some battery operated systems work with salt and electrolysis, producing chlorine. This is convenient as well due to the availability of salt. Distillation- This method works by distilling the water, usually in a solar still, to remove almost all impurities. UV Light- Battery powered SteriPens produce UV light and kill everything including viruses. This is similar to some of the best pool water treatment systems, is very convenient and may work in less than a minute, although pens are costly and you'll need fresh batteries. Filtration- As simple and quick as pumping the water through a filter. Each filter is different, but typically they remove 99%+ of bacteria, but not viruses unless a chemical is contained in the filter. You'll need to replace parts periodically and keep the system clean, but overall its pretty convenient. Sunlight Pasteurization- Depending on the sunlight strength and outside temperature, you can leave a plastic bottle of water in sunlight for 6 hours+. The heat and UV light will make water safe. The downside is that you need to look up or guess how long based on the conditions. Backwoods tricks- Survival techniques include many ways of obtaining water that is probably pure. They include distillation techniques (covered pits with pots, etc), and careful rainwater and dew collection or extraction and filtration by plants or clothing. None of these methods are convenient for daily use, and some are risky. None of these methods necessarily protect against chemical contaminants, although some water filters are specifically designed to ""filter"" chlorine or other common chemicals.

537,1,What mosquito nets can be used while camping?,"ones that hang (from a single center point, or from four corners),","There are several types and configurations of mosquito nets that you can use: ones that hang (from a single center point, or from four corners), ones that drape over your bag with one or two poles that go over your head to keep it off your face, full free-standing Depending on your situation, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Choosing a net: Areas with rampant mosquito-born diseases are likely hot as well, meaning you won't want a sleeping bag, so the ""draping"" type nets won't do much good A net that is too short will leave your feet or forehead pressed against the wall, inviting bites. Tucking the mosquito net under your bag, sleeping mat, mattress, etc is essential not just for mosquitoes, but for other creepy-crawlies. Free-standing bug nets shaped like a small 1 or 2 person tent you can pitch (inside a larger tent, or inside a hut for example) provide the most convenient and versatile option and tend to be easier to seal off. Remember that mosquitoes are not the only pests. The biggest annoyances are often the ""no-see-ums,"" which although don't carry illness, can make for a miserable nights. Choose a net with the smallest gap between the weave as possible. Chemicals: Permethrine: After 2 years of living in the tropical rain forest, and suffering the tenacity of mosquitoes and no-see-ums which manage to find their way through any tiny imperfection in the net, I just started treating my nets with Permethrine This stuff is highly toxic to fish, and insects, so care should be used when applying it - however I have found it to be highly effective in keeping mosquitoes and no-see-ums away from the net so they don't ever find those imperfections. DEET: Although highly effective as a repellent, prolonged exposure, to high quantities especially in hot sweaty environments, has been linked in some toxicological reports to some ailments. Regardless, I don't much care for doping up before I sleep - so tend to avoid it, though spraying clothes can be a good added measure of protection. Mosquito Coils: I am not sure the chemical agent involved, or the safety of prolongued inhalation of the smoke, but mosquito coils burnt around the sleeping area reduces the number of insects visiting. Citronella: Some people swear by citronella and lemongrass, either as an oil applied to the skin for short-term reduction, or a candle that provides a smoke repellent. Eucalyptus Oil: Provides a short term repellent, and can provide some relief for itching from those bites that already snuck through. As a final precaution, setting a (controlled) smoky fire burning in the corner of your hut, or tarp will help reduce the number of mosquitoes hanging around throughout the night.","ones that hang (from a single center point, or from four corners),",0.12141864,78,144,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/537

Silicone impregnated (aka silnylon or sil-nylon) is lighter than polyurethane-coated, and is supposed to be equally waterproof, but some people say silnylon can mist during heavy rains but it's more likely from condensation than permeability. A tarp that is polyurethane coated will usually have a flame retardant element added to it. Some tarps are coated with both in order to meet flame retardant standards. Polyurethane coatings are always on the underside, and may peel with time. Silnylon strengthens the fabric, while polyurethane weakens the fabric over time.

1102,-1,What can be safely trimmed on a backpack,non-strap item,"First, consider if you have the right backpack. If you're considering chopping off all sorts of parts, you might be using a pack that isn't designed for you. You could sell it off and buy a more minimalist pack, such as one from GoLite (I say GoLite because I'm unfamiliar with other lightweight packs). With that out of the way, consider what you want to use or carry. If there is no possible reason you would want to strap things to the outside of your pack, feel free to cut off those outside straps completely (the ones on the back that don't compress your pack at all). Most people like something there to attach things to when necessary, however, such as wet clothing, boots, wag bags, etc. There are sometimes one or two little loops of strap on the bottom of the back of your pack. Those are specifically there for mountaineering or ice axes. If you aren't going to be using those, cut them off (though they are good attachment points for other items, if you need it). If your pack won't be too overloaded, you can probably cut off the strap that goes across the top of your pack (the one underneath the lid, or ""brain""). If you roll up the opening enough, there isn't much need for it - though I use mine to hold a rope or other large squishy items. There are sometimes extra buckles, clips, and straps floating around on your pack. Find what they do, and answer in your head whether they are crucial to the load bearing of your pack or not. If they aren't, then they are convenience items and can be removed at your discretion (melt the ends of the nylon to make them pretty once you cut). If they are compression straps (usually these are on the side of the pack, and are pretty important to the comfort of the pack), don't cut them. You'll be much happier with them still around, despite the ounce of weight. The same goes for straps that hold the pack on you. Shoulder and waist belt straps can be shortened somewhat (carefully!), but don't make them so tiny that you can't make adjustments or put the pack on someone else. If you cut those types of straps, make sure you clean up the cut ends so that they won't slip through whatever buckle system they are installed in. Finally, be very cautious about trimming any non-strap item. Packs are notoriously difficult to repair if you cut up the wrong thing. Occasionally there are places you can cut off non-strap items, such as attached pockets or cute frills, but know that they might be hiding an important seam, or might be providing much needed waterproofness (as an aside, remember that there really aren't any ""waterproof"" packs. The material may be waterproof, but the seams aren't, and seam sealing an entire pack is very challenging).",non-strap item,0.181148037,2230,2244,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1102

3152,1,What shoes keep me warm in the cold?,Overshoes,"Overshoes When the boots' warmth is not enough, you can use overshoes. Basically, it's nothing more than a sack made of cloth , which you put over your boot and fasten somehow: This helps you in two ways: It creates an air pocket around your boot, reducing heat loss. The snow now melts not on your boot, but on the overshoe, drastically increasing the time before your shoe gets wet (and cold). You can try to shop for something like this, but you can easily create it yourself as in the picture above: fold a cloth to make a sack, sew 3 sides of 4, add some laces and that's all. You can use any synthetic (and maybe waterproof) cloth like Oxford or Cordura. If your sewing skills are higher, you might end up with something more attractive and better shaped: (some other designs are shown here ) If you need to use it with SNS/NNN ski boots, make small cuts on the toe. (The other option for skiing may be removing overshoes sole and glueing the remainder to the boot - a lot of expensive ski boots are made like this, but you can add another layer;)). Durability upgrade As you may have noticed, this design implies a relatively thin fabric being between your sole and the ground, so if you are not wearing skis or crampons, it's damaged easily. So it's recommended to make the sole of the overshoe thicker. The best thing for walking is an overshoe combined with rubbers/galoshes: Why, you can sacrifice some huge-size rubber boots for this. Warmth upgrade Overshoes by themselves provide additional warmth, but this may be not enough. To get really warm one should add another layer - warm overshoe (""chuni"") - between the boot and the overshoe. Basically it's crafted just alike, but you use a warm cloth (e.g. Polartec-100/200) and you don't need laces. P.s.

3789,1,What should I look for in hiking binoculars,a larger aperture,"I researched this and there are a few factors Aperture - This is the diameter of the objective (or front) lens and affects the amount of light taken in. Aperture is very important for low light situations. If you plan on using your binoculars near dawn or dusk, or under canopy, then you want a larger aperture. This is the second number used to describe binoculars. So 4x30 binoculars would have a 30mm aperture. Aperture unfortunately tends to linearly correlate with weight. Magnification - Simple zoom. The first number and indicates the zoom factor. So 4 in our 4x30 example magnifies by 4 times. 9 should be more than sufficient for most hiking. Mountain hikes with long open lookouts may call for more. Lens Coating - Lens coatings will significantly reduce glare and improve quality. At a minimum you want ""Full coated"" which means that all lens-air surfaces are coated. Multi-Coating will generally improve glare reduction and is exactly as it sounds... multiple different coatings. Roof vs. Porro Prism - Roof prism will be smaller, lighter, and more durable, but will provide a smaller field of vision as compared to porro prism. For hiking you want the durability and lightness gained with roof prism. Water/Fog Proofing - These features are critical if you expect to be in wet or damp environments. I have purchased (and wasted money on) more than one pair of cheap binoculars that did not have this. Waterproofing is usually accomplished with O-Rings, but fog proofing requires that the internal air spaces be filled with inert gas.",a larger aperture,0.117582642,293,310,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3789

Once injured, the only good solution is rest and anti-inflammatory medication while it heals. There are specific exercises and stretches that will work to prevent the injury.

6222,0,What hazardous wildlife is there in the UK?,the false widow and adders|Fleas and ticks,"In the UK we have, comparative to other countries, very few venomous creatures. However the false widow and adders are still a risk. False widows have mostly been recorded in the South of England and Wales (though I've personally never seen one) but have been recorded to have bitten and hospitalise people, whilst this maybe when out and about it has also occurred when people are asleep in their own homes. There are other spiders that are capable of biting humans, but of the 650 or so species in the UK only 15 or so can do so. False widows are also considered non aggressive. Adders are the only venomous snake in Britain (and again after 25+ years here I have never seen one, only a common and harmless grass snake) however the NHS still records roughly 100 cases of bites in a year. They are more common to heathland and sea cliffs. Be wary if you have a dog out with you as there are reported dog deaths and dogs being bitten by Adders in the UK as well. They will likely only bite when feeling threatened, and if you do see one in the countryside, just be careful, avoid handling and let them be. (I have now actually seen one! Slithered across the grass when walking the dog, 26 years it took to see one!) Deer should be treated respectfully in the UK if you happen to see any of the species (Personally saw a young Roe deer buck holding some rutting ground in my local forest.) We have Red, Roe, Fallow, Sika, Water deer as well as Reeve's muntjac. Some of the larger deer obviously have antlers over the autumnal months and can be aggressive during the rutting season but the likelihood is when out walking they will run from you - the issue here is being careful at night when driving they can come running out across the road (happens to me at least once a month) and they can go through a windscreen if hit. Also for dogs not used to deer, chasing them (also known as worrying) can lead to conviction and fines. Badgers should be avoided whilst out night walking, again more commonly when out with dogs, due to their ability to destroy footpaths / walking routes with their dens, creating risk of a twisted ankle or worse. Near where I live badgers have almost completely collapsed a footpath by digging dens underneath it, which is something to watch out for. The likelihood of seeing one would be slim however, but dogs who like running down holes should have an eye kept on them. As a note they also are likely to be a bTB carrier (bovine tuberculosis). Cows and Bulls are however a very common cause of injury when out in the British countryside. Cows can stampede when they feel threatened, especially when they have calves in the field. There were 215 injured and 6 deaths recorded in the UK between 2008-2011 due to being trampled by cows. However a good farmer will always signpost a Bull field or when cows have calves - allowing you to enter 'At your own risk' or leaving you to take another route. Wild boar were reintroduced in 2004 to the Forest of Dean, there have been reports of damage to gardens, and attacks on walkers, dogs, and riders in the area. Some people can worry about their dogs as Myxomatosis is a threat in the UK to British rabbits. It is not a threat to dogs or humans, but it can infect pet rabbits - so try not to handle wild injured rabbits if you see them unless aiming to take them to a vet or the RSPCA/SSPCA for treatment. And if you do need to handle them, anti-bacterial hand sanitizers will help prevent spread of infection. Fleas and ticks are also common both domestically and in the countryside in the UK and they can be nasty for both humans and dogs, and Lyme disease can be passed onto humans by ticks. There is also a debate / request you can find online and that comes up in wildlife searches for the reintroduction of Wolves to Scotland - however currently there are no wolves in the UK. Edit: Seagulls can also be a pest when eating along the coast as they can swoop down grab food from your hand, as they can get quite large these birds shouldn't be hand fed or encouraged.

6760,-1,What makes certain mountains more dangerous than others?,small change in weather,"I personally had a similar sort of a question when I first went through similar kind of stats about these mountains. Getting introduced with these stats is different than totally understanding the mountain and the pandora box it opens. For getting acquainted with the reasons for so many failed attempts, one needs to read tactical data and expedition reports. Understanding the weather is not a case because many a times bad weather make a walk in a park kind of a summit go horribly wrong. Logistics and Supplies: Along with the weather, the location makes it more difficult. These big tough-to-climb mountains are not easily approachable. Consequently, many a times you find the local support (labor would be an inappropriate term to use for these great people) like Sherpas and Porters tough to find, fund and convince to come. So things are too difficult with limited support. If you compare population of these local services around Mt. Everest with other mountains like K2, Kanchenjunga, etc, you would definitely get higher numbers for Mt. Everest, Lhotse and Cho Oyu. May be that is one of the crucial reasons for higher ratio of successful summit attempts to Failed attempts. It will be reasonably wrong to correlate this ratio with ""The Death to Summit Ratio"" . Many a times at these great mountains, failed attempt is death and vice versa. And there is a significant number of expeditions where people actually made a summit and unfortunately passed away on the way down the mountain. Afterall, its not only about standing humbly on the summit, but its more about being there at the top tip and get down the goddamn mountain. Some Technical Data One of the factors that makes K2 so challenging is the sustained technical difficulty. Period! It is like a cone of ice and limestone, and has slopes of 45 degree angles or more. Climbers typically fix up to 2,500 meters of rope on the south side routes, and up to 5,000 meters of rope on the north ridge route. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. Speaking of the weather, the sudden storms are caused in part because the peak is so much higher than the mountains around it, it juts up into the upper layers of the atmosphere and like a rock in a river can create eddies in the jet stream, with good weather on one side of the mountain, and life-threatening conditions on the other. That is not exactly the case for Mt. Everest, it being surrounded by another 2 Eight-Thousanders. Speaking of technical difficulties: That said, its a fact that Mt. Everest is not a walk-in-a-park and Any-Rich-Tom-Dick-Harry-can-summit thing either, but apart from void weather and a moderately difficult ice wall before ""Hillary's Step"" , Mt. Everest unarguably put much less challenges to a summit-optimist at higher shoulders of the mountain where rescue is difficult and unlikely, as compared to that of K2, Eiger, etc. K2 has its own agenda to deny a summit by means of Serac and Bottleneck above Camp IV. There is no need to even comment about how tough it is. Once Chris Bonigton was asked, ""What makes K2 such tough mountain to climb, even than Mt. Everest"". He had replied, ""It's enormous, very high, incredibly steep and much further north than Everest which means it attracts notoriously bad weather,"" On the North face Eiger there is are 2 technical challenges much talked about. One of them is called ""Hinterstoisser traverse"" named after Andreas Hinterstoisser and the other one is called as ""The Traverse of the Gods"" . Personally, I had my jaw-dropped when I first watched a documentary on Eiger North Face route. All the North Faces in the Swiss Alps were already climbed, but Eiger had parried away all attempts till it was first climbed on July 24, 1938 by Anderl Heckmair, Ludwig V√∂rg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek in a German‚ÄìAustrian party. I have not read and studied much about Nanga parbat, so it will be inappropriate to comment about the technical difficulties it offer. For Annapurna the technical difficulty is considered to be graded over Hard Severe for the climbing parts of it. The fact that it is considered as the one of the most sensitive Avalanche-Prone areas, adds more woes to climber's expedition. Overall, the technical difficulty level, Weather, Local Support altogether make world's few mountains tough ones to scale. The same goes without saying for many other mountains in the world which have considerably lower number of successful summits and a relatively dangerous Death to Summit ratio. TAT (Turn Around Time), Height Gain and Supply Management Its also interesting to compare the height gained from Base Camp to Summit. Height Gains: From Everest Base Camp (South) to Summit: 3484 m. From Nanga Parbat Base Camp to Summit: 3800 m (Approximately) From Annapurna Base Camp to Summit (Annapurna I): 3961 m From K2 Base Camp to Summit: 4711 m Does the height gain and the distance matter? Yes it does! Because these are all tall mountains and located at a higher altitude, the small change in weather is a major concern and the night sinks in so bad. The actual time for the Summit from the Pre-Summit Camp is a very short time-window. The Expeditions always have (if not, then should have) agreed upon a TAT (Turn Around Time). Turn Around Time is what ethical mountaineers refer as the time, clocking which every expedition member should turn back to the lower camp, no matter how close the summit is. This window between Start of the Summit attempt and TAT is substantially favorable for an expedition team in case of Everest as compared to the other mountains. Once I had gone off-road cycling my nephew in remote regions. The kid asked me, ""Why haven't you ever climbed that mountain?"" , pointing at a mountain I didn't know the name of. I said, ""I just may some day.

8026,-2,What are the principles of Leave no Trace?,Plan Ahead and Prepare,"According to the Centre of Outdoor Ethics , which runs the most widely accepted ethics program used on private lands for outdoor recreation, there are seven principles to leaving no trace: Plan Ahead and Prepare Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces Dispose of Waste Properly Leave What You Find Minimize Campfire Impacts Respect Wildlife Be Considerate of Other Visitors They are outlined on their website as shown below: The Leave No Trace Seven Principles 1. Plan Ahead and Prepare Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you'll visit. Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies. Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use. Visit in small groups when possible. Consider splitting larger groups into smaller groups. Repackage food to minimize waste. Use a map and compass to eliminate the use of marking paint, rock cairns or flagging. 2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces Durable surfaces include established trails and campsites, rock, gravel, dry grasses or snow. Protect riparian areas by camping at least 200 feet from lakes and streams. Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary. In popular areas: Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites. Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy. Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent. In pristine areas: Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails. Avoid places where impacts are just beginning. 3. Dispose of Waste Properly Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food and litter. Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep, at least 200 feet from water, camp and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished. Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products. To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater. 4. Leave What You Find Preserve the past: examine, but do not touch cultural or historic structures and artifacts. Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them. Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species. Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches. 5. Minimize Campfire Impacts Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Use a lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle lantern for light. Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires. Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand. Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes. 6. Respect Wildlife Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them. Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers. Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely. Control pets at all times, or leave them at home. Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, or winter. 7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience. Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail. Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock. Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.

8675,1,What are the basic considerations for hammock camping?,insulation is critically important,"I've been hammock camping for about four years, and there are a few issues you should be aware of. First, as already noted in the comments under your original question, insulation is critically important. I know that below about 65 F (18 C), I sleep uncomfortably cold. This is because your insulation (sleeping bag) beneath you is compressed by your body weight and the air under your hammock is free to circulate. Combined, this will quickly sap your body heat. The Hennessy Hammock I use has an insulation package available as an option. This consists of an open-cell foam pad and an ""all season"" outer liner. If this isn't warm enough, you can add a Mylar emergency blanket between the foam pad and the liner. Most importantly, this system installs on the OUTSIDE of your hammock. Using this setup, I have camped comfortably at temperatures below freezing. Videos of this system and how it is installed are available through their web site at http://hennessyhammock.com . Other options include using a foam pad or a Therm-a-rest style inflatable inside the hammock. Some hammocks have an option to install these trapped between two layers of fabric. Second consideration is the way you pitch your tarp. In general, it should be perpendicular to the wind (lest it act as a funnel). If possible, the ridge line should run above the tarp (rather than under) since this configuration will not allow water to run beneath the tarp if it rains. In addition to staking the corners of your tarp, make sure you keep the edges taut as well. If the wind picks up, the edges can start whipping around, creating a lot of noise at night. I run lines from the center of each edge to the tie-downs in each corner (which results in something of an 'W' shape) and pull these tight with a taut line hitch. Finally, make sure you know your knots. If they slip during the night, you will find yourself dragging on the ground or with a tarp flapping in the wind. If the knots supporting your hammock slip, the dip in the hammock may lead to your head and/or feet being uncomfortably elevated. Personally, I have taken to using hammock straps (such as the ENO Atlas) and carabiners with my Henessy. Once these are set and stretched, there is no noticeable sag during the night.",insulation is critically important,0.11598935,169,203,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8675

8841,-1,What is this plant? Is it Poison Oak?,Poison Ivy,"I have no knowledge of the plant, but I did find some interesting information, which I hope will help you. Western Poison Oak, also called Pacific Poison Oak, is common in your region. Poison oak, also known as Western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), is native to western North America with a distribution extending from British Columbia to the Baja California peninsula. In Washington and Oregon, poison oak is found mainly in the western regions of the states. In California it is widespread and grows in a wide range of habitats from sea level to the 5,000-foot elevation and in areas including open woodland, grassy hillsides, coniferous forests, and open chaparral. source Presenting most frequently as either a vine or bush, it can also be tree-like with a thick stem, growing to 9 or 10 feet tall. As with others in the family, the most tell-tale sign is leaves grouped together in threes, called leaflets, the middle being the longest. They're green throughout the summer, turning red in the fall. The leaves are often, but not always, shaped like those of a regular oak tree, although it's actually a member of the cashew, not the oak, family. Also, it's technically allergenic, not poisonous, which makes it less dangerous, though not necessarily less uncomfortable, than some other plants! The Sure-Fire Poison Oak and Poison Ivy Identification System is an extremely comprehensive 14-page booklet, with detailed information about the various types of poisonous plants; instructions for discerning their characteristics; drawings; and location maps. Unfortunately, your pictures appear to match many of the criteria: The middle leaf in the group of three is always longer than the other two. The veins that run off the main vein are in alternating patterns, rather than meeting each other. Though difficult to see, each leaf in the group has its own stem. If the leaves are joined together, it's a different plant. Tiny black ""resin"" spots, as well as other spots, scattered around on the leaves are not always present, but can be an indication. The leaf stalks always grow up the stem in an alternating pattern, never connecting directly across from each other. (This one is very important, and can be a determining factor in the identification. Since I can't seem to tell by your pictures, though, I can't say it meets the criteria.) From the same source: What you will never see on Poison Ivy or Poison Oak plants: ‚Ä¢ Flowers growing from the end of a stem. ‚Ä¢ Single large flowers. ‚Ä¢ Flowers any color other than cream or white. ‚Ä¢ Upright flowers. ‚Ä¢ Fruit larger than a pea. ‚Ä¢ Red, blue or purple fruit. ‚Ä¢ Leaf stalks directly across from each other on the stem. ‚Ä¢ Sharp spines. ‚Ä¢ A vine twining like a barber pole.

So the nearest higher mountain seen from B is A, see the distance marked as ""Dominanz"". Prominence is the difference from the peak to the next key col to which you have to descend at least to be able to reach a higher peak.

10116,1,What to consider while walking around a Geyser,stay on the established trail or boardwalk,"The big risk in geyser basins is that you can't see what's going on underground. There are often latent hot springs or fumaroles: areas where hot water or steam has eroded the ground almost all the way to the surface. If you step on one of these areas, you may break through the crust and find yourself immersed in boiling water or high-temperature steam. The safest option when traveling in a geyser basin is to stay on the established trail or boardwalk. Geothermal features do occasionally form under a trail, but it's not common, and trails are generally monitored for this. If you need to go off-trail and you're not familiar with the basin in question, the safest option is to only step where there are plants growing. The presence of live plants is a sign that the ground is cool. It doesn't mean you won't break through the crust, but it does mean that if you do, you'll only need to be rescued from a pit, rather than having your body recovered from a newly-formed hot spring.",stay on the established trail or boardwalk,0.137893885,413,455,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10116

Coyotes are present, but unless cornered will not give you any problems. The mostly likely encounter with 'dangerous' wildlife you might have would be with Rattle Snakes . There are several species, some more aggressive than others , found in the Mojave & Great Basin regions, although they are not very active during the colder winter months during which you are planning on visiting, however may seek out warm areas near humans. I have spent several years hiking & camping in the Mojave & have only ever come across exactly 3 rattlesnakes. Also remember that rattle snakes will not always rattle, especially if cold. There are several species of scorpions as well, however the stings of most are really no worse than a wasp sting, unless you have immune system issues or a particular sensitivity. (There are wasps too). The scorpion present in southern Nevada with the most potential for a deadly sting is the Arizona Bark Scorpion , it is to my knowledge not native, but I have found them in Las Vegas, most likely an introduced population or a lone hitchhiker. Note the wide body & coloring for identification. Scorpions are also not very active in colder months, however may seek out warm areas near humans as well. One animal with which people may get into trouble when they do not expect it, are the feral Burros & feral Horses found in the Red Rock Canyon area. These animals are very accustomed to people & may approach hoping for food (don't feed them, it is against regulations), so they are generally not a threat, however, I have seen mother Burros react quite defensively when approached & their offspring are nearby. Aside from that, they may be prone to bite or kick if startled. A similar caution should be taken with Desert Bighorn Sheep . Although you are unlikely to get near them, males will act aggressively if they feel they need to defend their herd. Black Widow spiders & Tarantulas are also present. Though neither are actively aggressive towards humans. One other thing to watch out for; the Teddy Bear Cholla . If you have an unexpected encounter with one of these, you will not soon forget it!

11034,0,What happens when someone dies on Mount Everest?,they are left there,"Above about 7500-8000meters, currently they are left there. One opinion based answer is because Everest climbers are selfish. Given many people who climb Everest won't abandon a summit attempt to save a life, do you really think they care enough to risk their life to bring a body off the mountain? (Current rates are 4% fatality of all summit attempts, presume body retrieval would be similar.) A more charitable answer is because above about 8000 meters you are in the death zone. You are slowly dying. You have very limited strength, and no reserves. It is impossible to do much more than put one foot in front of the other. You have very limited reserves (weather, food, water, warmth and blood oxygen level) and ""going to plan"" can become life threatening if just a couple of minor issues come up. As such, body retrieval, even if possible, is very dangerous, and more than likely, will just create more bodies. Who would risk their life to retrieve a body - would you? Give the presumed answer, the next moral question is is it right for you to ask someone else to retrieve a body and risk their life? Given the problem of the difficulty of moving a body, you could perhaps make it possible by bringing the bodies down in pieces small enough for one man to carry, there are a significant number of cultural and moral barriers to this approach. Even if you decide morally of all that is is OK, you then need to establish a price. There is a minimum cost of probably 1 million dollars (based on 10 men, Everest summit a costs of $100K each). Is it worth spending 1 Million dollars to retrieve a body? If its not 1 Million dollars, why not - why can you retrieve a body for less than that of when a summit attempt costs over $100K? Ok, so now we have got past the morals and established the cost, you hire someone, and go up there and they die in the attempt. What are the laws in your country around paying someone to do a job when you knew the job carried very high risk of death? So the real question should be ""Given what happens to a body and the fatality rate, why are so many allowed to climb it?"" Hopefully in time technology will make it practical and safe at a reasonable cost to remove these bodies, till then, its just an accepted fact of the Everest gravy train.",You are slowly dying,0.221282095,483,503,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11034

Its easier if you can just look at catalogs of manufacturers like Gransfors and get an idea of what you want as often you can find the name hatchet and axe used interchangeably in some sale catalogs, manufacturers are more precise. Generally though an hatchet is a small axe, so shorter in lenght and lighter head. To confuse matters a bit more there is the hand axe which is small like an hatchet but the head is shaped differently but people still call it an hatchet. There also are ""boys axes"" which are lighter axes, lets say something sometimes less than 2lbs head on a 28inch handle. You can make one yourself buying the head you need and fitting an handle of the desired length that you bought separately or making the handle from scratch. If you would want to dig a little deeper you could look for a tomahawk . Let all the movie ideas about a tomahawk aside. Tomahawk is nothing else than an Algonquin word that means ""hatchet"" and if you get a colonial era french axe and the tomahawks traded at the time they are the same animal. Overtime they took two different paths differentiated in shape of the eye etc and now we have a very different image in our head of what a tomahawk is while in origin was just an axe with a light head or an hatchet with a longer handle, same result. A search for tomahawks online will pull up a lot of garbage too but some companies still make ""colonial style"" heads for tomahawks that are still great for bushcrafting. Don't just use the longer handle idea just to go around a lack of skills as that might catch up with you, if you think you're gonna put the other hand in the way then you need to review your technique.",axe,0.094327353,1289,1292,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11105

FIRES are very common with this approach. Element protection - depends on if you are hauling out the boat or leaving it at dock in the water. If hauling out then protecting the decks and scuppers from ice and snow fall as well as freezing drains in the cockpit or like areas is important. Some shrinkwrap the entire boat. A waste of money and material. if you keep the boat in the water you have to check on the boat periodically, and if there is potential for freezing a hull heater or an air bubbler or ice prop, to keep the ice from forming at the waterline and crushing the hull is necessary.

Then you start what is known as kiting or ground handling where the you get the wing up into the air and use the controls to steer it and learn how to handle it while staying on the ground. True mastery of the sport starts with learning to control the wing on the ground. Unlike with a rigid wing aircraft, before we can begin to even think about taking off, our wing must first be ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù and placed overhead in just the right position. While many aspects of flying might come natural to new pilots, kiting is a skill that has no real comparison to anything we learn at a young age (even flying a regular kite). So new muscle memories must be developed from the ground up. ... These are the ground handling exercises that you will dive into right away: Gear inspection, prep and layout Pre-inflation body position Forward inflation Light wind ‚Äútaxiing‚Äù Reverse wall building Reverse inflation Reverse kiting Forward kiting Wing shut down Emergency procedures Source Groundhandling can be trained anywhere when wind blows, short grass and almost flat is preferred terrain. Ideal wind strength is 4-6 m/s without gusts. With less wind, front launch should be trained, despite its use at thermic take off places is limited, few times a year you will need it. If there are obstacles between you and wind, wind gets broken and good only for advanced training. I found it good to train groundhandling all the time wind was good. Even for 10 minutes before or after soaring/flying. All the actions should be trained to level, where you do not think about an action required, but act correctly without thinking. Source Most paragliding is done by taking off from hills, but kiting/ground handling can be done on a flat soccer field (I have seen it done many times). These exercises teach the skills needed while the trainee is still on the ground. As far as exercises go, there are a lot of times when the pilots hands are up high pulling down as that is how the paraglider is steered. From what I can find, upper body strength does matter, It's beneficial to have good upper body strength while flying your wing. The more you fly and handle your wing, the stronger the muscles in your arms will become. This increases and improves overall flexibility, mobility and range of motion. Source but it is also about technique. Paragliding is about finesse and serenity, not strength and adrenaline. We work to build your skills and knowledge, in order to help you exercise good judgment as a pilot. Source To address your questions of whether the situation described is plausible, consider that paragliders get stuck in trees all the time . STATE emergency service volunteers have helped to rescue a paraglider who stranded himself eight metres up a tree in the Gold Coast Hinterland. Source Also, while rare, paragliders have gotten high enough to pass out from lack of oxygen. Ewa Wisnerska, 35, was sucked 32,000 ft into the air ‚Äî so high that she lost consciousness from lack of oxygen and ice formed over her body. Hospital staff say the paraglider suffered severe frostbite from which she almost lost her ears. The adventurer said it was a miracle that she survived: ""You can't imagine the power. You feel like nothing, like a leaf from a tree going up,"" she said. ""I can't do anything. It's raining and hailing and I'm still climbing ‚Äî I'm lost."" ... She regained consciousness mid-air about one hour later. ""I wanted to fly around the clouds but I got sucked up 20 metres (67ft) per second into it and spiralled,"" she told The Sydney Morning Herald. ... Her ordeal was recorded by a global positioning beacon and a radio attached to her equipment. The swirling clouds released Miss Wisnerska from their grasp and she landed safely 40 miles from her launch, suffering frostbite to her face and with ice inside her lightweight flying suit ‚Äî but otherwise unharmed.

20305,1,What constitutes mountain exposure when hiking or scrambling?,your level of risk of sustaining a serious injury or dying,"""Mountain Exposure"" is a very broad term. Simply defined, it means you are exposing yourself to some risk of injury or death in the outdoors. Your level exposure while climbing is determined by how unprotected your climb is, which is summed up by how likely you are to sustain injury if you took a fall. On vertical climbs, the availability of anchors or placements for trad gear, and the availability of good holds constitutes protection; the lack thereof determines exposure. On hikes, the steepness of the slope, and ground cover determine exposure. You're much less likely to go tumbling to the bottom of a slide covered in thick willows than you are on a barren talus slope. The willows can stop and even cushion your fall, whereas you can cartwheel all the way to the bottom of a steep talus slope. The term is not exclusive to falling. Mountain exposure encompasses exposing yourself to the elements as well. Wind, weather, temperature, the sun; there are many levels of exposure. When hiking or climbing in good weather however, your level of risk of sustaining a serious injury or dying in the event of a fall is what constitutes your level of exposure.",your level of risk of sustaining a serious injury or dying,0.168586418,1037,1095,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/20305

21703,-1,What to look for in a portable generator?,alternating current,"There are basically two major types of generators for this situation: traditional and inverter generators. The expensive ones are the inverter generators, and the difference between the two types is the major price differentiator. The electrical power used in residential applications, and likewise the devices you'd power in a camping situation, is alternating current, at 50hz or 60hz depending on where in the world you are. Many devices, especially motors, are somewhat sensitive to the frequency of the generated power. The frequency of the power is directly related to the speed of the engine. As a result, for a traditional generator, the ability to throttle the engine is very limited, so what ends up happening is the motor runs at full blast pretty much all the time, regardless how much of the rated output you are drawing. In an inverter generator however, you have sophisticated electronics between the generator and the output. They are called inverters because they convert the AC of the generator into DC, then invert it back into AC. What this affords is precise control of the frequency of the output, and thus precise control over throttling of the engine. In practice this means that for a typical power rating, an inverter generator will be lighter, smaller, and quieter. Some of the nicer models you can barely tell are running if the load is low. Inverter generators are superior in virtually every respect except price. Apart from price, traditional generators are usually a better choice for industrial or commercial applications where the generator is meant to run full blast all the time, such as construction lighting and pumping applications. Once you are shopping limited to one style or the other, the differences in price should be sensible to infer from the specs, e.g. higher rating, trusted brand, quieter etc will all fetch higher prices.",alternating current,0.166572019,350,369,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21703

Chemical foot or hand heating packs work well and can prevent frostbite. You can warm your fingers or toes on someone else's stomach. You might be able to move around a lot and warm up your fingers or toes. When your body starts getting cold, it reduces circulation to your extremities (fingers and toes) and they get cold. If you can warm up your whole body, it will warm your fingers and toes. You can also get frostbite on your face if you leave it exposed to the wind.

345,-1,What causes an avalanche and can I predict one?,"The snow ""unit"" causes more snow to fracture in similar ways","This is an extremely deep topic which has entire forum sites dedicated to it. However I will attempt to summarize the key points for the average enthusiast. First - Don't ever travel into uncontrolled avalanche terrain if you have not received proper training from an expert in avalanche conditions, triggers, mitigation, and rescue. It's stupid, seriously you can die, and many people each year do . Second - If you receive training the first thing that you will be taught is to Always wear a transceiver, and know how to use it. It is very possible that your life or that of someone you care about will be saved by a transceiver. Your better off forgetting your ski's or snowboard than your transceiver. Third - Always carry a shovel, avalanche probe pole, and extra clothing when in avalanche terrain. Now that's out of the way Avalanche Overview Information is summarized from the Canadian Avalanche Center Snowpack Layering The snowpack is made of many layers of snow which are formed by climate factors from above the snow, and within the snow. These layers create a stratification of the snow crystals where some adhere more to one another than others. This creates a situation where fractures can occur, and some layers of the snow shift as a unit. The snow ""unit"" causes more snow to fracture in similar ways. This sometimes creates a chain reaction we call an ""Avalanche"" . Types of Avalanches Loose Dry Usually limited to surface layers, and pitches at or above 40 degrees Sometimes called slough, although they can still be very dangerous. Loose Wet Typically form in spring or summer, due to solar radiation (direct sun). Usually require slopes of 30 - 40 degrees to initiate. Wet Slab Generally created by extended periods above freezing. Pinwheeling, snowballing, and loose wet avalanches are predictors Storm snow Caused by a cohesive layer of new snow overloading the sub-surface snow layer bond. Generally avalanches peak during intense snowfall and decrease 24-36 hours following a storm cycle. Wind Slab Caused by wind deposited snow building up and overloading the sub-surface layer's bond. Indicators include ""ribbing"" and ""cornicing"" on leeward slopes. Persistent Slab Caused by a weak bond within the snowpack created weeks, and sometimes months prior to the trigger. Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. Very dangerous avalanches result from ""persistent slab"" conditions. Persistent Deep Slab Caused by a thick, hard, and deep slab of snow loosing it's bond with sub-surface layers. Most commonly caused by early season snowpack being exposed to long periods dry weather. Most common above tree line. Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. Cornice Falls Avalanches caused by large quantities of wind blown overhanging snow fracturing and falling onto a slope. Most common on leeward slopes where a ridgeline breaks the wind. Signs of Unstable Snow Whoompfing - A sound the snow makes (just say the word) when the sub-layer fractures from the surface layer. Sometimes creates shooting surface cracks. Check your underwear in steep terrain, it's scary. Recent Avalanche Activity - Observe the nearby slopes and ridges for activity of sloughing , wet slides, fracturing, or cornacing. Be aware of the environment around you. Always place your head on a swivel. Hollow sounds - While traveling across the snow surface. Stay off steep ridgelines, look for terrain elsewhere. Difficult travel due to breaking through snow layers. If the snow cannot support you while skinning (traveling to and from steep slopes using grippy ski bottoms), it is not stable. Consider lower angles or not skiing that area. Most Common Triggers Environmental Loading from new snow. Temperature or humidity Changes. Human Ski and snowboard travel Snowmobiling Explosives Reducing Avalanche Risk Do not stop or group in exposed areas Do not travel directly above someone in a party. Do not underestimate the danger of a slab avalanche, or how easy they can be triggered. Recognize terrain traps . Do Not travel alone, or apart from your party. Do not become distracted and stay in an exposed place for too long. Good Habits Use releasable bindings Follow low angle slopes Don't box yourself into a region when the slide will be, always have an escape plan. Avoid travel on cornices. Always monitor for environmental signs of avalanche. Watch for decreasing mental judgement, or influence from ""Powder Fever"" .

After my injury, when I could not hike, I started by hiking less than a mile, but I did it every week. Even only once a week, this will help. Pick a trail that's a length just a little hard for you. This is best if you have a nearby park with lots of interlocking trails. Interlocking is good because you can mix and match the path to increase distance. Increase distance before you increase weight. I would not recommend adding weight until you can hike 5 miles comfortably. Once you get to 5 miles, start carrying an empty pack. Next add your layer clothes (maybe it's cool enough for a jacket, but not needed when you warm up) Next add just a water bladder for drinking. To the extent that you can, I recommend packing things you will actually hike with. One, the weight is more representative, and two, the weight is going to be dispersed more realistically for actual hiking. If you train with other things in your pack just for weight you are more likely to train for a pack that's off balance. Buy and learn how to use hiking poles. They really do help, even starting out. If at all possible, exercise doing something you like, or in a place you like. If training is just misery you go through to learn to hike, you're less likely to train (and hike). Pick the day, time, and place that you are least likely to skip every week. Pick someone to go with you who will encourage you to never miss a hike.

There are some compound bows that can shoot faster with thin diameter arrows. Usually 55 lbs draw is enough to kill any large game. I shoot a 65 lb take down recurve when I train. Then I switch my bow limbs for 50 when I hunt (also train with it but not as much as with the 65). If you take look at Hoyt website they have hunters taking down buffaloes with 50 lbs bows. Also a lot depends on your arrow head and the diameter for the arrow. Thinner diameter penetrates deeper. Quality arrow head will slice up the heart so the animal bleeds out in matter of seconds. Also it depends what you prefer to shoot. Some guys like longbows because of the feel and raw power. But it takes a long time to master. Most people shoot recurves because they are easy to start with and are affordable. Also the bow generally does not vibrate as much as a longbow. Then you have compound bows.

705,0,What should you look for when buying hiking socks?,Good socks remove the bacteria and moisture that thrive in the environment created by sweating feet and help to prevent blisters,"Don't use cotton socks for hiking. When your feet sweat, the socks become wet, and take forever to dry out. Good socks remove the bacteria and moisture that thrive in the environment created by sweating feet and help to prevent blisters. Cotton retains moisture, thus cotton socks will not do the job properly. Rather, buy non-itching (""merino"") wool, nylon, alpaca, elastic, polyester, spandex, or polypropylene (can also be used as a layer between the sock and skin) socks. I wear wildland firefighting boots (all leather) for work, and they can take a long time to fully break in (6-12 months!), so a good pair of socks/combination of socks is crucial. I've found that I like to wear a thin sport sock under a full boot sock, which helps to add more padding and support up to the ankle, where it counts.

950,-2,What is the proper tension for a tent line,hard and fast rule,"There's no hard and fast rule for specific tensions that I know of, mainly because that will vary slightly depending on the conditions. As an average rule I tend to make them taught, but not to the point where they're pulling on the pegs. There's a couple of scenarios where I tend to slacken them off a bit though: When the pegs can't be fully pushed into the ground for whatever reason. In theory they should always go all the way in but sometimes if you don't have gear up to the job of penetrating the ground, they won't be as secure as they could be. If this is the case you generally want them tight enough for them not to fall off the peg, but other than that a bit of give is sometimes good. In high wind conditions I tend to slacken them off a bit just to lessen the chance of the wind pulling them too tight suddenly and snapping them. In these conditions though I make sure I've got some paracord or similar so that any repairs that need to be made can be quickly. Helps to brush up on your knots! Other guidelines are much more important though - things like having your pegs in at a slight angle away from the tent, making the lines nice and long and spreading them out well. I find those 3 things generally much more important than how tight the lines end up being.",hard and fast rule,0.031102514,11,29,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/950
1384,-1,What does it mean to cross load a carabiner?,weaker,"A carabiner is designed to be loaded only along the long axis, near the spine (leftmost figure below). It will be weaker in any other direction of stress. Primary long-axis strength should be marked on the carabiner spine with an up-down arrow symbol, and is typically given in kilo-Newtons (one kN equals approximately 225 pounds of force). Cross-loading is shown in the middle figure below. Strength in this orientation should be marked on the carabiner with a left-right arrow symbol. The gate is a load-bearing member even when the carabiner is correctly loaded, therefore the ""open gate"" strength is much less, as should be marked with a symbol that looks like an open carabiner. Be aware that the inward gate strength is usually much less than the outward cross-load gate strength because only the locking sleeve holds the gate in place. There is another weakness you need to be aware of: loading the carabiner at a point or direction away from the spine. This happens in ""tri-axial"" loading seen in the rightmost figure, or with a nose-hooked carabiner (1) (2) . This is or can be even weaker than the cross-loaded configuration. Here is another instance of tri-axial loading ( source ). This is probably not as weak as a carabiner loaded the same way but upside down, because the offset-D has a shorter lever arm in this configuration, but it is still weak : Likewise a carabiner loaded with multiple ropes, or a single rope with a bulky knot, even if loaded in the same and proper direction will be weaker on the strand(s) farther from the spine. ( source ) I came across an analysis of an accident that was determined to be due to tri-axial loading of a carabiner. It examines tri-axial loading in considerable detail. Investigation of the May 4, 2014 Incident At The Ringling Bros. And Barnum & Bailey Performance In Providence, RI Also relevant is a video of testing oval versus offset-D carabiners in triaxial loading, indicating that the strength of that particular steel oval was apparently unaffected at 55¬∞ between ""arms"" of the load.

1845,1,What should be carried in a standard Geocaching bag?,GPS receiver,"I would definitely pack the following: GPS receiver - this may be your phone if you're starting out, but a dedicated receiver really does wonders if you're looking at Geocaching often. They're more accurate and don't eat through batteries as quickly. If you are using your phone, packing a cheap spare may be wise depending on where you're going - you don't want to use up all the battery, then land yourself in trouble and not be able to phone anyone. Spare batteries for the above ; if they're rechargeables make sure they're fully charged and not worn out. Personally I use Eneloops, they hold their charge for a good length of time. Printouts of locations and clues to all your caches ; even if you've put them on the GPS I find it much easier flicking through clues and logs on paper. Don't forget to look at recent logs as well especially if you're stuck which might offer more of a clue. Pen / pencil. Take multiples, and don't take expensive ones. They have a habit of going missing since they come in and out of the bag a lot, the pack of 8 cheap as you get pens at the local stationary shop will do just fine. Tweezers. Incredibly useful for extracting tiny logs from nano-caches. A couple of (again, cheap is fine) spare pads / rolls of paper. If you spot caches whose logs are full, it can be a huge help to the cache owner if you leave a bit more paper until they get around to replacing the log. Torch (known as a flashlight in the US). Essential if you're night caching, but very useful to have either way. Great for peering in dark places that caches might be hiding in! Camera. Not essential, but Geocaching can often take you to new and cool places, often when you least expect it! I've wished I've had my camera with me on several occasions. This is not necessarily an exhaustive list at all, and I'm only counting things here that are directly relevant to Geocaching. Obviously if you're after a cache in the middle of a cave you'll need additional suitable equipment, and the associated caution and expertise. Additionally, things like first aid kits, food, etc. would be sensible if you're venturing out a way, but the list above should serve as a good ""geocaching-specific"" checklist of some things to take along the way.",GPS receiver,0.618801534,39,51,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1845

3236,0,What kind of Tyvek is suitable for footprint material,the hard-type,"From what I've discovered there are really two main types of Tyvek: hard-structure and soft-structure. The numbers you refer to are variations in applications of the two types. Hard-structure, type 10, is most commonly recognizable in the housewrap application and is suitable for a ground cloth. It is stiff, noisy, and loud but that can be remedied. Soft-structure has two main varieties: types 14 and 16. Type 16 (1622E, 1673) is not suitable for a groundcloth as it has lots of tiny holes in it. Type 14 (1443R) has a soft hand and is just as water resistant as type 10 (10G or 10GX) so either type 10 or 14 will work for your application. I might recommend the hard-type as it will be easier to lay out your groundcloth to cut and measure. After you have completed it you can then wash it several times to soften it and make it more manageable. It also will be easier to find as you can get it at both Lowe's and Home Depot. However, I don't know if you can buy small quantities there. You also might check construction job sites (with permission) as they often have some left over that they just throw away.

I will give you some of my recommendations; I have tried them all myself except for the hard boiled eggs: Beef jerky/pemiccan : it is very nutritious. It's my number 1 recommendation for food on the trail (regardless of whether you have celiac disease or not). You can make it yourself if you want to. Dried fruit : water is heavy, so dried fruit is a lightweight and nutritious snack. A little bit sugary perhaps, but that shouldn't be a problem on the trail (when you're burning lots of calories). Raisins are my personal favorite in this category. Coconut oil : also very nutritious and high in healthy fats. You can eat it raw, cook with it or you can make cookies with it. Honey : either raw or used in recipes. Raw nuts : again: nutritious and lightweight. Dried seaweed and kale Hard boiled eggs : as long as you have a hard container that keeps the shell from breaking, they won't spoil for two to three weeks. That's what I've heard, at least, I haven't actually tried it myself yet. Canned sardines Food bars : Tankabars , Pure Bars , Kind Bars , Lara Bars , and many others Dark chocolate : not all chocolate is gluten-free, so check the ingredients list! Vegetable chips : these carrot chips , for instance. Also, most food in nature won't contain gluten. It's not something you should rely on (i.e. I would also take enough food with me), but some knowledge of the local fauna is always a good thing. However, it's a difficult subject , but it just is one more option that you may be interested in. It seems hard at first to find out which foods you can and cannot eat and to find good substitues for each of them, but you get used to this fairly easily. I at first thought that this would never be doable to head into the wild whilst following this diet (which is more restrictive than a gluten-free diet), and now I feel as if I've got more than enough options.

4134,,What are the dangers of swimming in natural waters?,sharp limpets can also live on rocks,"This is highly dependent on the type of water as well as the location, but I'll summarise a few things to be aware of. In many locations most of these dangers won't factor in, but they're useful things to bear in mind if you're trying to assess the danger of a particular body of water. I'll focus on the sea here - for other things such as rivers similar things apply (but there's obviously other things to look out for, different kinds of wildlife, waterfalls, etc.) Currents : Yes, there are areas of sea that can ""pull you in"". (The same obviously applies for rivers here, but this is less commonly thought of with the sea.) More dangerously, there are also currents that can ""pull you under"". Similarly, and sometimes just as dangerously, there are areas of the sea that can ""pull you along"" the coast horizontally. This can sometimes be dangerous simply because it's much easier to miss, and can pull you into dangerous areas such as: River outflows : Along the same guise as currents, but these can often hide at full tide and seem to appear very suddenly and strongly if you move into them. Quicksand : Not often thought of when you're in the water, but if you decide to stay on the bottom for a while and hit a patch of this, it can root you to the spot. Watercraft : Again, something that's often missed, but stray jetskis (for example) can seriously injure or kill you if they hit you full on. Hidden depth : While you can often expect beaches to fall down at a gentle angle, there are often hidden areas that can suddenly drop away. While not an inherent problem if you're a good swimmer, these can often be associated with undercurrents too - so beware. Personally I'll only swim on beaches I'm familiar with at high tide (and have seen at low tide) to try and mitigate this somewhat. Wildlife : This varies greatly - some areas can have deadly sharks (or similar) in them, and these risks go without saying! However, bear in mind more common things such as jellyfish (some of which will just give you a nasty sting and others that can be lethal) and crabs (which will give you a nasty nip if feeling threatened.) Know what lives in the waters you're swimming in, and be prepared accordingly. Sharp rocks : This goes hand in hand with wildlife in that sharp limpets can also live on rocks, making matters worse - but just because the entrance into the water looks sandy, doesn't mean it is all the way through. If you swim at high tide and stay in while the sea recedes, you may find yourself painfully clamouring over all types of nasties. Same goes if an unexpected large wave throws you against such rocks. Pollution : Like any body of water, you should be aware of pollution - especially after storms many runoffs will quickly head into the sea containing a variety of toxins and bacteria. In some countries / areas factories are still permitted to dump waste into the sea directly, in this case I wouldn't even risk getting in the water!",sharp limpets can also live on rocks,0.101212494,2265,2301,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4134

I try to do this as infrequently as possible, or before a winter trips where failure of the membrane would be very unpleasant or dangerous. For other clothes - base layers, fleece, etc - I wash them as little as possible or only when they are visibly dirty (or stink to high hell).

Storage is ideally hanging in a cool, dry place with no direct sunlight, but this isn't always possible. I live in a city, where closet space is at a premium, but if you live in a house and also don't want to clutter up your closet, I would say a basement is better than an attic. Regular use will be far more degrading to a membrane than folding, and by the time the membrane is failing you will probably be onto the next big thing, whether due to fashion or technology.

6053,,What are the Pros and Cons of Trekking Solo?,increased severity of issues caused by any injuries and higher risk of attack by animals,"I think there are several factors to consider when traveling alone. Pros You can set your own pace. For me this is one of the main reasons to hike alone. When with other people they often want to go faster than you and you end up breaking yourself trying to keep up or are slower/less confident and you have to slow down/not do those 'interesting' scrambles you would want to. More flexible. Similarly when on your own you don't have to worry about what other people want. If you decide you want to take a detour or break you can if you want to push on to the next campsite you don't have to worry if anyone else is exhausted. More peaceful. Being on your own also gives you more time to think about things and admire the beauty of you surroundings without having to worry about being sociable. Easier logistics. If all your friends are busy (or you have no friends) you can either hike on your own or not at all. Cons Less support in case of injury. This is one the most commonly cited disadvantages. If you fall/trip/do something stupid and do yourself a serious injury you have no one else to help you. How serious an issue this is will depend on your situation. For injuries where you can walk out it doesn't really matter if you are alone as long as you have a decent first aid kit and can treat yourself. For more serious injuries it depends on location. If you are in heavily trafficked areas where there are almost always people around then its not so much a problem as hopefully a passer-by will assist you. On the other hand if you are in a back-country trail which sees one group per week or less then anything which stops you walking could kill you. Greater risk from wildlife/humans. Depending on where you are hiking there may be dangerous wildlife or risks from other people. In general these risks will be greater when traveling alone. Dangerous animals will view a single person as easier prey than a group, and a group of people will often make enough noise to scare away any nearby animals anyway. Heavier pack. Many pieces of equipment don't scale directly with number of people. E.g. you only need one stove and tent if there are one or two people. This means if you travel alone your pack will probably be slightly heavier although this is a minor concern. Can be lonely. Being on your own all day can be very lonely particularly at mealtimes/evenings when you would normally chat with the rest of the group this can leave you with little to do particularly once it gets dark. This may or may not be an issue depending on your personality. To decide whether you are comfortable hiking alone you must decide whether the pros out way the cons. The main cons being increased severity of issues caused by any injuries and higher risk of attack by animals etc. The risk caused by injuries will depend on where you are going and how careful you are. Generally one does not break their leg walking. If you don't have an injury the fact that you would be screwed if you do doesn't matter.

If he/she is a crucial member to keep going, may be the group should agree to call it off, and decide to turn back or set up a camp, depending upon the supplies and the location. You'd never want to make someone walk back home is he/she is really in not a shape to sustain the exertion. Check what dependencies the group have over him/her and make a group decision if He/She can rest and be accompanied by one of the members (preferably the most experienced member), while other go on and come back in a few hours. For a multi-day hike, I'd recommend sticking together, no-one goes ahead, either rest or turn back. If its something like Diarrhea and/or Vomit, Inquire if He/She has drunk and/or ate from unhygienic sources. Food poisoning can get worst by every passing hour. Sometimes sun stroke can also cause similar symptoms. Whatever the reason, everybody turning back and getting to the nearest medical center should be a wise, sensible and obvious decision to make. If its something like Migraine or bad headache, inquire if He/She has been struggling with Acrophobia or similar issues while exerting at higher grounds. If its a casual Headache/Migraine, then may be He/She can be accompanied by someone wiser and rest in the tent (if the group has brought along) , a mountain hut or some safe place, preferably sheltered (considering if its rains) . If He/She is still able walk neatly, group should consider asking him/her to walk down to the car with someone wiser accompanying him/her. That shall be the safest place to rest. Inquire if He/She has some sort of a reaction from general medicines like Metronidazole, Domperidone, Aspirin, Amoxicillin, etc. Out of these, Amoxicillin is an irregular member in the bunch of medicines known generally. Its used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. I always keep it with me, just in case. One should also consider a fact that overdose of Amoxicillin can cause Diarrhea. If that is not an issue, you can consider giving him/her the required and suitable pill. (I assume, if you have them in the Medical Kit at first place, you are expected to have general information about dosage) . Its usually advised to sit back and rest after you take some medicine. In case of Fever, its not out-of-the-blue, the symptoms can be observed before the mercury rises. In such a case, its a wise call to turn back. If its a multi-day hike, and if someone starts suffering from Diarrhea or Vomit, you should ensure that the person is kept Hydrated and if possible consider starting towards nearest medical facility. Just a side tip: I have observed that eating apples helps to at least control Diarrhea. If someone gets bad migraine on a multi-day hike, you can consider camping immediately rather than making him/her walk further. On a multi-day hike its very much possible that you have to stay, and you can't just turn back and go home. Spending a night in such a case is really difficult for the person as well the ones who care for him/her. 1. If its Diarrhea: Diarrhea is one of the common things that can screw your trek. Keep the poor fellow hydrated with water and Pedialyte, Rehydralyte or similar products which are available without prescription. Give him/her fruit juice (asynthetic, without pulp), broth, soda. Do not give him/her milk and milk-made products. Roasted/Boiled Potatoes are good to eat. Just keep in mind that too much of salt or sugar can aggravate Diarrhoea. If you have Oranges with you, then that is a good food to eat since they are loaded with vitamin C and believed to aid in digestion. Keeping something warm on the belly may also help relieve abdominal cramps. May be a collapsible hydration pack filled with lukewarm water? Diarrhea is mostly non-contagious, so its totally okay that the carer shares the tent with the one who is suffering. 2. If its Fever: Elevated temperature, pulse, and breathing rate; chills or hot flashes, sometimes flushed skin, headache are symptoms of Fever. Make him/her wear light clothing and keep the bedding light. Medicines like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen relieve pain and reduce fever. I'd personally not consider taking both of them at the same time. Measure his/her body temperature regularly, if its getting higher, sponge him/her with cold water. Keep him/her hydrated. Abrupt fevers are mostly due to climatic changes. So being a caring person I wouldn't hesitate sitting by him/her in the same tent and keep the person calm, but that is absolutely personal opinion. Just in case if you are not ready to gamble about contiguous fevers, then you might consider setting up an alarm to check his/her temperature, make it quick, wear a mask or at least cover mouth and nose, wear gloves, use sanitizers. But that is not me, I wouldn't do that to the person, especially up there on a mountain, but again, thats a personal opinion.",setting up an alarm,0.041465852,4659,4678,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6789
6872,,What to look for in a winter skills course?,Avalanche,"I can't speak for the Scottish winter and there definitely are differences to the Alps. But still I can give you an overview what is important to learn if you are going to do alpine summer tours in the Alps. The German Alpine Club (German: Deutscher Alpenverein, DAV) is the world's largest climbing association. The number of members is over one million. (source: ""Deutscher Alpenverein"" ). I will therefore give you the topics which are covered by the glacier courses (courses for alpine tours). The list might seem long but I think it gives you an idea what to look for. 1. Basic course rope up on glaciers crevasse rescue general techniques with ropes, knots and belaying walking with crampons ice axe techniques anchors in ice and firn abseiling self arrest on firn orientation planning routes checking material weather first aid environment and nature protection 2. Advanced course repeat basics going on combined terrain with faces and ar√™tes climbing (leading and following) belaying in steep rock, firn and ice advanced ice axe techniques hitting pitons return strategies mountain rescue and much more... There are additional courses for crevasse rescue which show the importance of this topic. Avalanche is only a topic in winter courses. I guess they aren't learning the topic of avalanche because it is pretty complex for itself and you are generally trying to avoid situations with a lot of fresh snow in summer. Of course they have avalanche courses but it's not a topic in those glacier courses! My personal advice is to take a course which covers the important points from the basic course above. How to rope up on glaciers is the first thing you have to know and it's not very complicated. But still you should learn the general ideas from a professional (distances long enough to hold possible falls, maybe using knots between members, having rope for a possible crevasse rescue, NOT meeting up when you are doing a break...). Crevasse rescue is also important, I would suggest that you learn at least one method. Under real conditions the rescue might be really tough but having stopped the fall of a companion (or even two) you could still call the mountain rescue services most of the times (still: learn how to rescue someone fallen into a crevasse!). That being said it shows the importance to actually get into this position of braking the fall, setting a deadman and so on. To rope up on glaciers, to be able to belay correctly and to rescue crevasse falls you naturally have to learn some knots. You cover this in the fitting sections of the course. Maybe they don't write those topics explicitly in the description but I am pretty sure all will cover this. Check the course requirements though. Techniques with crampons and ice axes are nice to learn although I don't think they are as important as the security relevant topics mentioned above. What's really important is how to set an ice screw correctly. Still, you will be using crampons in all glacier courses and you will be excited if you do it the first time. I personally didn't had big problems walking in them but you should care when you climb in them or you might get some porous trousers like I did...",Avalanche,0.096155718,1204,1213,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6872
6949,,What are the advantages of being short when climbing?,allowing you to reach the longer moves that you may struggle with,"As a disclaimer I'm 6'3"" so this isn't from experience! As a tall climber you're correct, I have a lot of advantages. Reach can be very advantageous, especially on bouldering. In my experience the disadvantages of me being tall (therefore the advantages of being shorter !) are: I have a longer reach but I also have longer levers. This means I find certain power moves more difficult. Taller people tend not to be as powerfully built as shorter climbers so again I'm maybe lacking in sheer strength (to weight) sometimes I find close claustrophobic moves difficult. My elbows and knees can get in the way. Shorter climbers often find these moves easier as they are in more natural positions for them As a shorter climber you need to train for your advantages. So train for power moves. Use your lighter weight and shorter levers to perform dynamic moves. This also has the advantages of allowing you to reach the longer moves that you may struggle with. Most important is technique. A climber with good technique will out climb any climber with worse technique, regardless of physical features. There are lots and lots of examples of brilliant short climbers The legend that is Joe brown was well known as a short powerfully built man. I wouldn't say a shorter climber should train much different to a taller climber. A shorter climber will often simply need a different Beta to a taller climber, i.e. a more dynamic move to reach the holds, different foot positions, etc. I'm a firm believer that the best training is climbing. So stick at it. Try some dynamic jump moves and practice them, use this to help you out of sticky situations. Work on your grip strength (dead hangs, etc.) but I would recommend this to anyone climbing short or tall. tl;dr I climb with a guy who's better than me. He's also a lot shorter than me. It really annoys him when I can just reach something that he can't. But 9 times out of 10 he'll climb stuff I can't. That is simply because he's better and height is almost irrelevant. So don't let height be a disadvantage. Keep practising and getting better and it will become less and less of an issue.",allowing you to reach the longer moves that you may struggle with,0.033251502,888,953,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6949
7664,,What kind of underwear inside union suit in winter?,Gore Active Shell,"When you are facing a serious sweating problem, maybe your overall setup is too warm. What layers/jackets do you wear above the one-suite-fleece? I am thinking of a very thin layer which is highly breathable and will just be a shelter against the elements (wind, rain/snow) like e.g. the Gore Active Shell. Still, sweating to some degree is pretty normal. What I can recommend in general is merino wool. It feels comfortable and warm also when it is wet. It also dries fast. Please check this link . Also very very nice is that merino doesn't attract bacteria like common materials like cotton or synthetics. Especially for underwear this is a unique and great feature. Going on multi-day trips you (and your friends) are still fine when you have 2 pieces of underwear with you. Relating the comment of @amphibient: You are right, cotton absorbs the sweat which isn't that favourable. Synthetics and also wool will transport the moisture to the outside. Your outer layers have to work the same way, otherwise your system won't work. Wearing a high-end merino shirt won't help when you have a cotton pullover over it. Regarding your one-piece fleece midlayer and your one-piece hardshell outer layer, this might be great in terms of being waterproof and warm (no wind will break in) but I think you don't have the versatile options normal setups have. I am able to open zippers under the arms or open the main zipper from the top or even from the bottom when I feel slightly too warm.

8700,,What are some simple tasks to teach knife safety?,"make a simple bow & arrow, make a walking stick/spear","As a kid we often went on hiking trips and I got my first knife when I was around eight to ten years old. Below are some of the things my parents looked out for when I was a child. Obviously this is addressed at an even younger age than OP described, so you might have to adapt it accordingly... General advice For beginners either get a fixed blade , or one with a sturdy lock - not one that freely folds together (e.g. not a Swiss Army Knife). A good example would be: Opinel kids - My first Opinel If you chose a folding knife, first teach how to safely open and close it and how the lock works. And obviously you should only use it properly locked. Never use a knife when standing on uneven footing (i.e. some slippery tree trunk) or in a moving vehicle. Teach beginners to always work the knife away from their body . Whether cutting fruit, carving wood, ... --> never cut towards you or your extremities. That way if you slip you're far less likely to cut yourself. Also teach a beginner to always cut away from other people . For the same reason as above really. For kids it can be a good idea to get a knife with a blunted point : using the point effectively requires a lot of skill, and at the same time a knife without a sharp point is really a lot safer. Btw, if you can't find a suitable knife with blunted point it is quite easy to grind it blunt yourself using any file. Less about safety, but still valuable advice when dealing with kids: Choose bright colors so the knife can easily be spotted when it's lying around. Put the knife on a cord or chain that attaches too the belt (or similar) to avoid loss. Activities/Techniques Cutting a branch of green wood (where appropriate of course). Teaches efficient cutting techniques. Peeling the stick. Teaches control of the angle of the edge and cutting away from the body. Sharpening the stick (to roast sausages/marshmallows/...). Teaches about controlling the blade in relation to the wood you are cutting. Advanced: Carving patterns (e.g. rings/dots) into the stick (or into a stick which still has its bark). Teaches detailed control of edge and/or tip. Generally I'd try to find some kind of useful 'project' that involves knife work and just try and do it together with whomever you're trying to teach. Examples that come to mind: make a simple bow & arrow, make a walking stick/spear, build some small shelter, build a rack that allows you to suspend a grill/kettle for outdoor cooking.","make a simple bow & arrow, make a walking stick/spear",0.112230889,2300,2353,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8700

My old development is now around 15-20 years old and has them as well. It's also quite common to find it in towns and cities in public spaces like parks. They're also common along scrub land, as they're quite hardy, where they grow naturally. They're a native species to the UK. Many farmers use them in hedgerows as well, and you can find them along many - if not most - footpaths. I'm not 100% sure why farmers pick them but they are a thorny bush that is quite bulky and therefore not only builds a good hedge but helps endorse the farmers requirements to maintain a hedgerow that is a good, safe habitat for animals (hedge rows make good wildlife corridors). The bush itself, Prunus spinosa , is also one you can purchase and plant in your own garden if you do not want to go out foraging, but that does cut some of the fun! It has a common name of Blackthorn . For recognizing them : The berries themselves are quite easy to mix up with juniper but the leaf shape distinguishes them, which is oval shaped and lighter green than those of the juniper bush, but a point to make is also the bushes are not small.

10189,,What are the dangers of descending/rappeling very quickly?,you burn yourself,"First some general dangers not related to melting: Burning your hands braking on the rope (can also happen with semiautomatic descenders like a grigri due to reflex) Uncontrolled impact on the rock Without a backup knot (e.g. prusik) and with a passive descender (e.g. tuber, eight) you may let go of the rope due to the heat induced pain or when impacting on some unexpected obstacle. Grigris do not have a panic function, meaning when you pull the lever all the way there is no more resistance. This has lead to incidences. The problem with heat is mostly discussed in caving and canoing communities, as there are commonly huge distances to descend. Still the best source I found was Black Diamond, whose engineers have done some tests on this. They looked at damage to the sling holding the descender device, but the results are still relevant. Some introductory information: For argument's sake, Dyneema, Spectra and Dynex are all the same thing. Basically different brand names for UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene), which has a melting temperature of around 145 ¬∞C (293 ¬∞F). Nylon has a melting temperature of around 245 ¬∞C (473 ¬∞F) If something is in the neighborhood of 70 ¬∞C (158 ¬∞F), it's basically too hot to touch A typical ""hot knife"" used at climbing shops to cut accessory cord usually tops out at over 650 ¬∞C (1202 ¬∞F). Skin burns at 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F) An old assumption in climbing is to spit on your belay device. If it sizzles, the assumption goes, then it's hot enough to melt your rope, slings, etc. In simulated situation with ATCs and 181kg weight they reached a temperature of 256degC, with 114kg and a thin rope (8mm) 170degC. To see whether this is reproducible in a real situation they did a field test. They measured at the bottom of a 150foot (45m) rappel and 10mm rope. When descending at what they describe ""kamikaze speed"" the 100kg test person reached temperature of 130degC. To test longer distances they used a fishing rod to get the device up again fast. They did six runs with the following temperatures: 111, 110, 131, 120, 125, 135 degC. I do not agree that this means they really peaked at 135degC (i.e. it would not heat any further), but the device could cool off significantly between runs. Next they tested at what temperatures a belay device actually damages material. On Nylon (polyamid) marks on the fabric are seen at 300degC and it has been cut at 325degC. As heat radiation increases with the 4th power of the temperature and real testing only reached temperatures of 135degC max, I do not expect that you really reach such temperatures.

10256,,What precautions need to be taken when night-caching?,simple common sense of respecting your surroundings,"There are a few, many of which are in common with simply hiking at night, but some are specific to geocaching. Firstly, the old scouts saying of be prepared! Make sure your torches, whether hand held or head, are properly charged (or you have spare batteries for them) as you don't want to get caught out in the dark without a light source. This also goes for your GPS, spare batteries or keep it charged (and a good old fashioned map doesn't hurt either!). Secondly, take good note of any warnings on the cache information page - for example the night caches near Coombe Hill in Buckinghamshire have a person limit on them due to the proximity of the location to Chequers (Prime Ministers's home) too many people can lead to men in suits with guns coming up and asking what you're doing (though the Chequers staff seem to check the event page now and then as they don't bother us for the Midnight events!). Thirdly, consider your terrain, a LOT of night caches are trails... meaning you'll only get the start coordinates. Take care to waypoint the main caches or markers on route so that you can get yourself back to the start without incident... we took a 'short-cut' once and ended up scrambling up and down a 20ft gully in the middle of the forest, we really should have followed our waypoints back. Fourthly, the weather... recently a friend of mine did a seriously cool sounding Zombie night cache... but due to the horrific rain, and getting lost, the cache lost a lot of it's appeal! Fifthly? Take a compass! Seriously ... heavy tree cover or proximity to a pylon has on more than one occasion skewed our GPS positioning, and when you need to find 'the north east track after 50 paces' you may struggle when the GPS leads you astray.

10282,,What is the correct ice axe grip when descending?,facing backwards,"TLDR As long as you can walk normally (using the whole foot not just the toe area) always hold your axe at its head with the blade pointing backwards. More information This depends on the situation you are in. The text from Grivel seems to be a oversimplification. There is not just one technique for ascending and one for descending. There are two basic methods which are applicable for both ascent and descent (regarding how you hold the axe). Moderate terrain / Walking on snow This is likely the situation in question here, as in the question hiking and not mountaineering is mentioned. This includes both flat and steep terrain. The latter as long as you can walk with all points of the crampons in the snow (i.e. ""normal"" walking). Here you hold the axe at the head with the hand closer to the slope with the blade facing backwards. Here the axe is used to hold your balance and self arrest in case of a fall. The blade is facing backwards exactly for that: self arrest (the video in the question and this TGO question explain this well). Steep terrain / Ascending on toe points When the terrain gets too steep for the above technique one turns to face the snow and ascends plunging the toe pieces of the crampons into the snow. The axe is held at the shaft and arrested with the blade in the snow, so you can support your weight on it and use it to pull yourself upwards. Here a slip simply must not happen, the chances of being able to self arrest would anyway be slim. This is why you kind of ""continuously"" arrest with the blade facing forward.

The brushing will help separate the hair to keep it from matting and will allow more air drying to occur. Also, if you use chamois leather to dry him off initially it will keep you from soaking a towel right away. The chamois will absorb a lot of water, but is easily wrung out to absorb more. This trick will get him mostly dry, and then you can finish drying him with a towel if you'd like. One last thing I'd suggest is a small bottle of deodorizing spray.

11095,,What is a suitable workflow for cutting down trees?,Cut down one tree. Trim off all the branches,For the purpose of my answer I'm going to assume there aren't any special considerations like a tall tree on a small lot. In general I think this is the best procedure: Cut down one tree. Trim off all the branches. Build a big pile of small branches that aren't useful for firewood. a. Load this stuff into a trailer and dispose of it as appropriate when you have a full trailer worth. b. Alternatively you can run this stuff through a wood chipper and sell/use the chips. Cut the bigger branches into a length that will fit in your and/or your customer's fireplace comfortably. Cut the trunk into rounds the same length as the branches in step 4. Load the rounds/branches into the trailer once you have a trailer full. Stack the rounds at your house. Repeat the steps 1 through 7 until you've cut the amount of wood you need and/or you need to use some firewood. Split the rounds and put them into a different stack. Repeat the cycle as needed. The main benefits of this plan are: You don't risk leaving wood to rot on the ground because something comes up. You can split wood in the evenings at home on days when you couldn't go out and cut down trees. You have some shade while you're chopping up the tree into manageable bits. You don't risk having too much wood at once. The animals can still use the trees until you need them. You don't overuse the same group of muscles. (Thanks ab2 !),Cut down one tree.

11230,,What sleep quality do you get in the outdoors?,soundly,"Quality of sleep can depend on a multitude of factors. These are some of my experiences: Quality and appropriateness of gear Most people sleep poorly if they get too cold or too hot. Having a quality sleeping bag that is appropriate for your climate and time of year will definitely increase the likelihood that you will get quality sleep. Material matters when it comes to sleeping bags. Down will regulate temperature better, but is useless when it gets wet. Synthetic materials are poor at regulating temperature, but keep you warm even when they get wet. Don't buy cotton. Having a sleeping pad will contribute to a good night's rest. The ground acts as a heat sink, especially when your sleeping spot is on sand or rock. Forrest duff will act as an insulator, and I will go lighter on the sleeping pad if I know in advance that I will be staying below the timber line. When it comes to sleeping pads, you have a choice between air mattresses and foam pads. The former can be a bit noisier and obviously can be susceptible to leaks, but, in general, is lighter and more comfortable. The latter is cheaper, and can withstand a beating. Some people sleep best in a tent. Some people sleep best under the open sky, or as close to it as possible. In the summer, I often just bring a tarp in case it rains, since I have a hard time getting up in time if I sleep inside a tent. Tents (or insect nets) are a major plus when setting up camp next to mosquito-infested waters. Maintenance of gear If you get wet you will sleep poorly. Make sure you keep your sleeping gear dry. I keep my sleeping bag in a dry-bag to prevent it from getting wet. Experience For a couple of years, I have led wilderness trips for children. I have observed a correlation between children who spend time outdoors on a regular basis and getting better night's rest. I suspect this might have to do with being in an unfamiliar environment. On longer trips, most children were sleeping well at the end, probably due to exhaustion and a new-found familiarity with the outdoors. The human factor I find that the single most annoying thing for myself when trying to fall asleep in the outdoors are inconsiderate individuals in close proximity. European campgrounds can be very dense, especially during the peak season, and often, at least, one group of individuals does not respect the quiet hours. For that reason, I avoid proximity to others whenever possible. I have a pair of noise-cancelling headphones that I use (they don't have to be plugged into anything) when I find myself in a situation like that. For me, it also helps if I can be next to a source of white-noise, like a creek. When going backpacking, especially in areas where you have some choice when it comes to campsite selection, the ""human factor"" can often be completely avoided. I have been on many trips in the mountains of California's Sierra Nevada where I had the nights completely to myself. Environmental factors Many people sleep poorly at elevation. What the elevation is that makes people sleep poorly varies heavily from person to person. In my experience, the slower you gain elevation, the better you will acclimatized, and your sleep quality improves. I find that heavy rain does not distract me unless I am worried that my stuff could get wet. It helps with ""the human factor"" as well since people generally won't stay up as late in poor weather. It also provides white noise, which helps me sleep. The elements pretty much tie back to the appropriateness and quality of gear. If I trust that my gear will withstand the situation, I normally sleep soundly. The sun can be a factor as well. If you would like to sleep in during the summer months, make sure that you set up in a shady spot. There is nothing worse that waking up in your sleeping bag inside a tent that has been baking for 30 minutes. The unavoidable I have observed (on myself and others) that often the first night can be rough, even with good gear and a lot of experience. Your general disposition. If you have trouble sleeping at home, you will probably find the same to be true in the outdoors.

11369,,What is a splice in spools of tubular webbing?,two pieces of webbing taped together,"Do spools of webbing still have splices? Yes. As Paul's answer pointed out, there was a well-known accident caused by a climber purchasing webbing with a tape splice in the middle. Furthermore, multiple retailers have various warnings that spools may contain up to three sections (ie, two splices) per 300ft spool of 1in webbing. http://www.cmcrescue.com/equipment/tubular-webbing/ Note: Military standards allow for up to three sections per spool. http://www.strapworks.com/Flat_Nylon_Webbing_p/fnw1.htm For most webbing the maximum continuous length is 150ft, after which a new roll is started. How weak is the splice? It's just two pieces of webbing taped together. The tape's stickiness is unknown, so it should be considered to have an effective breaking strength of 0lbs (0kN) . However, in actual tests (slide 13) by Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, tape splices break around 25lbs (0.11kN) : Result 1 : Adhesive failure, tape intact, webbing pulled out, 20-25lbs (0.08-0.11kN). Result 2 : Tape tore (see photograph), adhesive held, 24-28lbs (0.10-0.12kN). How big is the section of weakness? Presumably only the tape-covered portion of the splice is effected.

12988,,What attributes does a good reliable beginner kayak have?,stability (primary and secondary,"Can you specify you don't look for a whitewater kayak? Other than that the use you will do, and expect of doing in the future, of the kayak will be a big part of your choice: a little calm inland lake and sea will call for two different kayaks. My suggestion to beginners is always to try as many as you can, through renting, dealers demo days, clubs and gatherings. There should be a little bit of homework you need to do about kayak characteristics before going to buy something, learning about the meaning of terms like stability (primary and secondary), tracking, rocker, what is a skeg and what is a rudder and why they are there or not, etc etc. All together they will make you understand a bit how the kayak works and what you want to have or not. It will also help in understanding if a salesman is trying to find something that suits you or something that suits his commission. Generally speaking you have a couple of extremes, on one side there's the performance boat, it's designed to respond readily to the paddler and a beginner will find it very nervous, impossible to have it do what they want. At the opposite side there are some models that are designed to take absolutely everybody in the water, they are not maneuverable at all, the bottom is very flat, difficult to capsize. They cost little but they also do very little for you, they will not improve your skills and they won't offer any room for you to grow. The problem with not improving your skills is that all is good in calm and flat days but sometimes being a better paddler helps in getting out of some uncomfortable situations. It was mentioned that flat bottomed kayaks are more stable, that's true, that's because that shape will always try to follow the water surface. The problem with that is that when you are in waves that same extreme stability works against you as it will tend to follow the surface of the waves. A kayak a bit more unstable, while might seem tippy at first, is less affected by the waves and you will get used to it quickly enough (sometimes you might find yourself in bad weather, even if you have been careful, other times other boats could put you in a difficult situation). Don't pay too much attention to things like speed, what you really want is to look for efficiency. For that same reason, unless you and your wife have the same size, she might like better a kayak slightly smaller than yours. Consider used boats too, the prices are often low for kayaks that are in very good conditions, and at the beginning price is something to consider as there are a lot of other things you need to buy beside the kayak. Older models also have so many reviews online you can get a bit of an idea about them before even trying them (obviously every review is to be taken with a grain of salt). Look for courses in your area, beside learning the basics in a proper and safe way they will clear your ideas on the kind of kayaks around, make you connect with other fellow kayakers, point you towards some good used kayaks. Also take into account your space for storing the kayaks and how to transport them: sometimes one can't get what they want because they don't have enough room. Think about a kayak as a pair of shoes, you cant really have one shoe to do everything,this is the same, there are tons of different models out there, if you start building your own they get even more. As a beginner you might not have a clear idea of how you will use the kayak, a bit because you might expect something different from what you actually get to do, or because you end with friends that steer you towards one activity rather than the other.

12997,,What to look for when buying used windsurfing equipment?,beam,"Several things that I can think of just now! First, look online for best windsurfing equipment for your personal case : beginner, intermediate, advanced? That will determine the size of the sail, the mast, the size of the board etc... The more you know before going to buy anything, the least it is likely you will make a mistake buying something of poor quality Second, make sure your equipment all connects together and the mast can freely lean in any direction . Third, check for the sail . Has it been patched up? If so, how? Does it have bad scratches looking as though they could open up with high wind? (and back to first , is it the right size for your size and level?) Fourth, the state of the board. Especially the fin . The fin is supposed to be put straight down and hold, and you are supposed to take it off or to leave it flat with the board. Make sure this freedom of movement is good otherwise you'll have a bad time resisting water current at sea or carrying your board on the sand after a day out windsurfing. Fifth, the uphaul - that little rope - that will allow you to pull the sail out of the water . If you don't have that you can probably change it yourself, but check for it anyway! And finally, I would talk about the beam . Is that not too damaged? Plenty of people tape them up which is perfectly acceptable so don't get too worried over that if it feels strong. Other than that, really it comes down to common sense and your instinct. I'd advise you take a look at second hand shops for a little while, that will allow you to realise what to look for.

13168,,What ropes could I use to suspend a hammock?,two,"The strength is dependent mainly on the angle between the two ropes form, on which the hammock is hung, and the weight you want the hammock to support. For a traditional hammock the angles of the ropes (measured to the horizontal) are about A=30¬∞ (just an estimate). Lets assume we want to design the system for a person weighing W=200lbs . Then we can derive a formula for the force ( acting on the ropes using trigonometry: Force on each rope (in the same unit as the weight W): F = 0.5 * W / sin(A) (Note that the Force gets extremely high, the closer to horizontal the ropes are / the close a is at 0¬∞ ) With the assumptions from above we get F = 200lbs , but this is just static loading, as soon as you ""dynamically"" sit down in it the forces can be higher. I'd go with a safety factor of about 5 to be on the absolute safe (that means 5 times the static weight it absolutely needs to support, consider that any knots weaken the rope, a knot can reduce the strength by up to 50% ), so that results in about 1000lbs strength. I have no experience using parachord, but this site also suggests to use rope of at least 700lbs - 1000lbs .

13379,,What footwear did mountaineers wear in the 19th century?,shepherds footwear,"Great question! In the UK, in many ways the cradle of mountaineering as a sport, it was common to wear traditional shepherds footwear known variously as shepherds boots , fell boots or hill boots depending on your location. We don't need to speculate about how these boots performed, because you can still buy them today. The bootmakers William Lennon of Derbyshire have been making hill boots since the Victorian period using the same designs, materials and methods. CONSTRUCTION Here's how Lennon describe the construction of their hill boots: Made from reverse tanned waxed kip butt leather which is ultra durable yet very giving and flexible when broken in. Manufactured using the brass screwed and stitched method which incorporates a vegetable tanned leather insole and throughsole for comfort and breathability. The boot in the illustration has what is known as a fully sprung sole . As you can see, there is an upward curve at the toe which reportedly adds a slight spring to the step and eases walking uphill. Here's a party in the Lake District in 1873, wearing very similar boots: TRACTION The soles were heavy gauge double or triple leather, with iron plates to protect the heel and toe and a pattern of single and triple nails for additional traction: As mountaineering became more popular, more specialised nails became available, and you can find lively discussions about the best patterns to use: Durability was an issue, as the metal had to be quite soft in order to get a good purchase in the leather of the sole. This wasn't solved till 1912 when a Swiss jeweler invented a way to braise a soft spike to a hard head and launched the Tricouni nail. Rubber Vibram soles didn't appear till 1937, and the sole designs we use today reflect the nailing patterns in use at that time: MAINTENANCE To condition and waterproof the leather, the boots were dressed with Dubbin. This is a preparation of natural wax, oil and tallow that dates back to Medieval times. I used it as a kid, and it's very effective. PERFORMANCE According to users these boots break in well and are very comfortable, waterproof and durable in use. But compared to a modern walking boot, they are heavy. The nailed soles work well on soft ground and snow, but can slip on smooth surfaces and are challenging to use on technical rock. One drawback of the nails is that they conduct heat away from the foot in cold weather. It was common to wear a couple of pairs of thick socks.

These benefits apply to other outdoor activities also! That's why the hat is popular among all kinds of outdoorsmen. However, I'll explain the advantages based on fishing but it's mostly common sense to figure out similar circumstances for other activities. First of all, fishing often means to be a lot in the bright sun (on a boat, near the river with no trees etc.). That's why a good fisherman hat provides a UV protection of 40+. Product features Material: 100% organic cotton Brim: approx. 5.3 cm Height of crown: approx. 8.5 cm UV protection 40+ From random example product They are also waterproof for nearly the same reason. If it starts to rain, everything is fine (at least around your head) :). Also they can be used to scoop and hold water (practical things like bucket-replacement but also to cool yourself down or drink) then. Additionally they are of course breathable and stay on your head while it's windy (they sit tighter than a hunting hat for example). This is important since you often investigate strong winds while fishing (open water). For colder temperatures, there are even ones with fleece.

13530,,What are the downsides of baiting game while hunting?,If the population is low or at risk and there is high volume of hunters,"I grew up in Washington State (Western US) where baiting was not only unpopular it is illegal. Depending on the animal and the area baiting may or may not be illegal to some extent Example; Waterfowl Hunting and Baiting, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service I currently live in a part of the US where it is not unpopular and mostly legal. The following is my perception on why both cases are the right choice, with deer as the example. In the Western US there are large tracks of land mostly un-populated by people. The majority of the deer population are in these underpopulated areas. Hunting is a sport, we go out and hunt (search for, kill and consume wild animals in their native habitat). Baiting, is considered in the same category as: Shooting Fish in a barrel, using enhancement drugs in sports, cheating on exams, non-consensual intercourse. Sure it brings results but if your going to go to that point there are many ways to get the same results without making immoral choices, like go to the store and buy beef. In the Eastern US there are very few tracks of un-populated lands. Deer live in the suburbs, in some cases they are considered to problematic . You can't go into the woods and walk for miles looking for deer, without finding way more houses then you do deer, even with an average of 30 deer to the square mile . In many cases significant planning needs to go into finding a shooting (fire arms) position that is safe. Hunting deer is closer to chore that happens to fill the freezer than a sport. Many hunters will hunt with arrows out of necessity as the deer are in area where there is no safe fire arm discharge area. In summary it depends; are you and the animal being baited interacting as a challenge in the animals native environment ( forest ), or if you are interacting in the peoples environment ( suburb ). Are you hunting a majestic beast, or exterminating a tasty vermin? In the end: ultimately baiting increase the harvesting rates for the animal. If the population being harvested (hunted) is higher than the ecosystem will tolerate, than baiting is ultimately a good thing. If the population is low or at risk and there is high volume of hunters baiting is a bad thing. Humans are part of the ecosystem, they have powers of reason and can understand cause and effect. If humans want to maintain a stable or alter the ecosystem they make choices that influence the population, baiting is one of many tools that can be used to impact the population in an area.",If the population is low or at risk and there is high volume of hunters,0.07849095,2108,2179,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13530
13570,,What to look for in a quality archery target?,Stopping power,"Stopping power The target should be strong enough to stop arrows reliably . It's better to work with a good margin here, especially if the target is used with different arrows (carbon tend to have a lot more piercing power) or stronger bows. Arrows should always be stopped well before the fletching reaches the target, otherwise you'll run into the danger of the fletching being damaged (oftentimes it is just shaved off cleanly). Don't damage arrows Obviously the arrows shouldn't be damaged , even after repeated use. This also holds for whatever construct you use to hang/install/put-up your target. E.g. using a heavy metal frame to hold up your target will mean that any arrow which accidentally hits the frame will be toast. Ease of arrow removal The target should be soft/flexible enough to allow easy arrow removal (if you have to put too much force into it there is always the danger of damaging the arrow). Durability The target should hold up for a good long while without falling apart. Styrofoam is an excellent example which fulfils most of the other requirements, but fails spectacularly on the durability (it'll dissolve into nasty tiny bits after very short use). Stable build This concerns more how you put up your target and less how you build the actual target. The entire construct should be quite stable, so as not to be moved/thrown over while shooting at it, removing arrows or because of wind (the latter can destroy a whole bunch of expensive arrows at once). Price This one is kind of obvious, but came up frequently back when I was trying to create archery targets. The proper archery foam target blocks can be amazingly expensive, not to speak of actual 3D foam targets which cost even more. Straw can be a decent and cheap alternative here, but has its own drawbacks. Weather resistance Optimally a good target would resist wind and weather, which is the case for many synthetic foams. Straw bales or designated straw targets, while cheap, don't like getting wet/moist.

14218,,What to look for in Marine Grade Expanding Foams,if they are not compatible with other expanded foams,"The foam is a quick way to securely glue and fill the gap between block and hull without going to heavier products. All the expanding foams will eventually degrade and in practice you could get plenty of years of service from any expanding foam. There are a lot of different kind of formulation and availability is a big factor in repairing. Even the closed cell foams wont be completely closed cells, meaning that one small portion of the foam will have some open cells (technical specifications usually indicate what percentage, but its minimal and absorption will take years) products used today are much better and consistent than what there was years ago, that's why you find that some older hulls are more prone to get waterlogged than others. Don't get scared by the terms ""compromised if submerged for a period of time"" as they tend to cover constant immersion situations for years (floating docks etc) and not the condition of a properly maintained hull cavity. Clearly you need a closed cell expanding foam, an open cell will end being a sponge and drying out becomes extremely difficult, sometimes impossible. I'm not sure if we can name products following a question, however if you go to a chandler asking for a 2 parts closed cell expanding urethane foam there are a few, very common brands that are all perfectly suitable, some formulation might attack slightly the Styrofoam surface but usually sets right away so they don't present a problem, manufacturers indicate in clear if they are not compatible with other expanded foams and you can still try on a small piece to be sure. If you never used them, the way they expand can surprise you, generally they can be poured in layers so do a bit at a time as they can make damages expanding and always leave the room for the foam to expand into, don't trap it between two blocks or it will separate them, for example a crack in a foam block will have to be cut open leaving two wedges >< so the new pour will expand towards the outside. A couple of inspection ports are usually added to the deck (splitting apart the hull is definitely not recommended) to allow for complete drying out of the cavity if waterlogged, it can take months in the worst cases so a warm place and a small fan to circulate air (that's why two inspection ports) inside helps. With the inspection ports and draining the cavity as regular habit you wont have the problem of a waterlogged foam block. If you reuse everything and there are no gaps to fill you could go even with plain glue. Careful that open cell and closed cell are different formulations and not all closed cell are the same, glues that bond one kind might melt another so the glues will indicate the types of foam they are formulated for. 3M is one manufacturer but there are others, check your local supplier, epoxy can work for that too. If you foresee a foam repair because of an hull crack (you indicate that in a comment) be aware that you don't really need it: the crack can be repaired from outside without removing any foam block and if you were to reach the foam to properly apply a fiberglass patch, the epoxy used to laminate the patch will do its work in bonding it to the foam. (pretty much as it bonds in a foamcore construction) Just as a note, there used to be a Sunfish Knowledge Base page somewhere on the net with repair guides also.

14446,,What can I do about a rock climbing ban?,demonstrate that the area is being used responsibly,"Access to climbing areas is an ongoing issue in many climbing areas. In the United States for example, it is claimed that 1 in 5 climbing areas is threatened by an access issue. There are many funds , societies , and advocacy groups who work on behalf of climbers to protect public access to climbing areas, to keep them open to the public for recreational climbing. Try searching for an access group that works in your area. The issue of access is not always so simple, as there can be multiple factors to consider when it comes to certain crags. Around where I'm from, there's pretty much open access to everything , because most of the climbing areas are on crown land. There are however a lot of cliffs and boulders that are on private land, and private land owners have the right to prohibit trespassing on their property. The biggest concern with climbing on private property in some countries is liability. In North America for example, If someone gets hurt climbing a private crag, then the landowner is legally liable, and can be sued. Most land owners prefer to restrict access to their lands instead of risking the possibility of even one lawsuit. Local authorities are especially likely to restrict climbing on municipally owned lands, because they are regularly subject to a plethora of ridiculous claims (people frequently sue towns and cities because they can't be bothered to be accountable for tripping over their own feet on the sidewalks, and hurting themselves). In the USA this is especially common because in many cases suing is the only option an injured person has for paying their hospital bills. One sensitive issue with a lot of climbing areas is the presence of native art on the rocks. I know of several areas nearby that are prime climbing areas, but climbing there is somewhat controversial because it can do damage to the ancient art on the stone. Access to areas where native art is present is often restricted, and it just so happens that in most places where native art is preserved on stone, the rock is prime for climbing. If climbing has been banned at your crag ""for safety reasons"" then it sounds like a local authority issue, in which case your best chance of restoring access is to partner with a access group, and petition the local authority. If you can show the authority that an area can be responsibly climbed, then they may work with you to open access to climbing. Talk to the CAO or City Manager about presenting to your council, that should always be your first course of action when seeking change in a policy in a municipality. As far as preventing access issues, what you need to do is demonstrate that the area is being used responsibly. Leave No Trace ethics will ensure that no flags are raised about improper use of an area. I've seen crags full of garbage and covered with graffiti. There's a now-popular climbing area close to where I live that used to be closed to climbing. The Town of Frank in Alberta used to prohibit people from climbing on the millions of boulders which were the result of the worlds largest rock avalanche, that buried most of the Town early in the 20th century. I remember when signs used to be posted on the side of the road telling you that climbing on the rocks was prohibited. Today it's a renowned bouldering area with thousands of established problems, with more new problems being established almost weekly. Access was granted after it became clear to the municipality that bouldering was a huge tourist attraction, and promoting the area attracts a lot of tourism and benefits local businesses.

There are several fabrics that have this desirable trait. Many of them are synthetic blends, and modern chemical engineering is constantly improving the state-of-the-art in moisture wicking fabric. As to the other part of your question, the answer is definitely yes. You can get practically any garment- underwear, socks, hats, shirts, pants, shirts, jackets, ... - made using one of these fabrics. The price points are typically higher than standard fabrics, but some are reasonable as well. From here, I'll leave it to you to shop for exactly what you want. EDIT: As an after-thought, note that there is a difference between absorbing and wicking. A fabric that absorbs pulls sweat into itself, and holds it. A fabric that wicks pulls sweat through itself, from wetter areas to drier areas. Absorbing is usually bad- it leaves you feeling wet and sticky. In cold times, that wetness degrades any insulating properties of the fabric, and it hot times it slows evaporation, negating your body's natural attempt to cool itself through sweating. Wicking is preferred, as it moves the sweat away from the body and allows it to evaporate on the outer surface.",synthetic blends,0.069770776,192,208,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14562

Depending on your strength you can reduce your swing or eliminate it. To see some extreme examples of core strength allowing you to hold improbable poses do an image search on ""gymnast on rings."" There are even some training exercises you can do for climbing on rings, but any core conditioning exercises will help. For your specific problem I think increasing your core strength will be the best, but that is more of a long term plan. In the short term I'd ditch the bat hang since it is clearly generating too much angular momentum for you to control at the moment. While your pictures are excellent I can't evaluate the problem very well just with pictures, nor am I an amazing climber. That being said, I'd recommend figuring out how you can get a foot on the hold that you have your right hand on in the first picture. By putting your foot there you will be able to grab the next hold without an uncontrollable swing. It seems to me that you could heel hook the hold your feet are on with your left foot on the forward edge. That would open your hips and allow you to put your right foot on the hold your right hand was on. From there you should be able to remove your heel hook and grab the next hold with your right hand.

This can be an internal event for the tree, or due to an external trauma like the top of the main trunk of the sapling being browsed by wild life, leaving lower branches to compete to become one or more primary trunk. Schoolmarm's pose risks on two fronts. The junction between the trunks is more likely to catch water and/or debris, leading to rot that will cause it to fail (die and/or fall) earlier then it neighbors.

17835,,What is the lightest arrow practical for target practice?,as light as the material that the arrow is made of allows,"The weight of the arrow depends on the material used to make it. First let‚Äôs understand that you pick an arrow based on the weight of the bow (poundage) and the archer‚Äôs draw length. That will give the spine (group) of the arrow you should be using. There are ways to play with spine... longer arrows, heavier points, etc but let‚Äôs forget this for now and just follow the recipe. You will find some aluminium arrows have a similar GPI (grains per inch). As soon as you move to the more specialised top of the line arrows they move from aluminium to carbon and then from carbon to some crazy alloy and the GPI changes significantly. If you pick the right arrow with the right spine for the right length arrows will vary in weight based on the material they‚Äôre made. Then weight play another part of the game. Lighter arrows has less drop as you said but are more susceptible to wind and also more fragile. You shoot a few light arrows on a tree and they start to split. Hunting ones are heavier as they need to hold more energy for penetration. Also it‚Äôs unlikely hunters will be shooting further than 30-40 meters/yards so distance is not the point of those kind of arrows. Olympic archers will be looking for mid ground where arrows are not too light to be influenced by wind in those 70 meter shoots but also not too heavy to avoid the extra drop. EDIT 1 I have a feeling that as much as I added info RE arrow weights and materials I didn‚Äôt actually answer your question. The lightest arrow practical for target shooting will be as light as the material that the arrow is made of allows but strong enough to be shot by a bow of certain poundage.

Taken that James are not going to hide in this garage and make his Jame's special super light alloy to make his arrows we only have wooden, aluminium and carbon arrows available.

19172,,What extra gear to take up a multipitch climb?,small headlamp,"There are two main schools of thought: the ""fast and light"" / ""light is right"" / ""rope, rack, shirt on your back"" camp and the ""be prepared"" / ""safety first"" crowd. When taken to extremes, blindly following either ethos can lead to trouble. Like most everything in the mountains, it comes down to experience on similar routes, judgement, acceptable risk tolerances and even willingness to suffer. However, these are some of the things I consider when racking up at the base of the climb: The Descent Will you rappel straight back down the route when finished, or is there a long walk-off descent? If rappelling, then there is usually little need to take your approach shoes up the route with you. If there is a walk-off, then you will most likely need to take your shoes up the route with you (note that some walk-offs are not necessarily unreasonable to do barefoot, provided they are relatively short and have reasonably non-jagged / non-pokey terrain). Shoes are usually dealt with by simply clipping them off a rear gear loop on your harness---note that having lightweight, low top approach shoes or trail runners instead of high top hiking boots will make this much less annoying. How long will the route take? Neither routes nor climbing parties are created equal. Leading at your limit might take upwards of an hour for a single pitch, while a strong climber might lead the exact same pitch in fifteen minutes. More than almost any factor, the amount of time you spend off the ground and away from your pack will dictate what you take with on the route. For an extreme example, Alex Honnold soloed Freerider in under 4 hours, while a more average party would probably take a portaledge. Be realistic in your estimates, and don't forget to account for time spent at belays getting racked up for the next pitch. One rule of thumb would be to figure between sixty and ninety minutes to lead and follow a pitch for a party climbing a route that is within their abilities (but not trivially easy) with good rope management and organization at belays. Tack on some extra time if climbing with a party of three. Are you climbing with a longer rope / willing to simul-climb short sections in order to link pitches? Are you comfortable running it out over easier terrain, or do you like to sew pitches up, frequently placing gear? Does the route have complicated route-finding and require building gear anchors at hanging belays, or is there a line of bolts leading to a bolted anchor on a ledge? Is the route a straightforward jug haul/hand crack, or is it delicate slab climbing? Don't forget to account for descent time! Doubly so if the descent is intricate. If it starts getting dark or weather starts building, do you have the margin to accelerate your pace and quickly fire the rest of the route, or is the climbing difficult and already at your limit? How committing is the route? Is the route easy to retreat off? If it gets towards dusk, can you just pull the plug and rap back down to the ground off of fixed anchors? Or is the only feasible way off the route to top it out and take a walk off descent? How long until dark? One of the absolute easiest pieces of gear to take up a multipitch route is a small headlamp. A bad situation can become truly epic, if not fatal, in the dark. Rappelling into the darkness towards an unknown anchor is a nightmare and the type of mistake you generally don't repeat. A headlamp is easily carried by either clipping or girth hitching it to a gear loop. Some truly small headlamps (e.g., the Petzl e-LITE ) can even stash neatly in a pants pocket or the zippered pocket found on some chalk bags. What's the climbing like? The nature of the route can make a large impact on how much extraneous gear you're willing to take up a route---off-widths and chimneys are annoying with a mess of extra gear clipped off your harness and downright frustrating with a backpack. While this can be somewhat mitigated by intelligent racking or clipping a backpack off a sling to trail behind you, it is an annoyance that is best avoided if at all possible. In contrast, a 5.7 hand crack or ridge scramble might be almost as easy with a pack on. What's the weather like? Even though it is currently a sunny day, always keep in mind that the weather could (probably?) change. Red Rocks, Nevada, is infamous for winds that come whipping down the canyons in the evening and the Rocky Mountains commonly generate afternoon thunderstorms on days that start with clear skies. Will you have a clear view of approaching weather? Would you be able to retreat if you see darkening skies? If the weather did turn, would it just mean being a little bit cold and wet, or would it be an emergency without extra layers? Consider slightly overdressing, e.g., wearing technical fabrics, pants instead of shorts, and perhaps even an unzipped thin jacket. While it might be overkill if the weather stays nice, it can make the difference if there is inclement weather. Some wind / rain jackets can stuff into a pocket and have a carabiner loop for clipping it to your harness; you can also find a small stuff sack for the same purpose. Alternatively, you can tie a jacket around your waist---make sure to tie a good knot and ""twist"" the jacket up to avoid having a large flap of fabric in your way. Food and Water Try to tank up on water and eat a snack before starting a route in order to minimize on the amount you need to take with. Snacks can easily be stashed in pockets, while a water bottle is usually clipped of a rear gear loop (soft-sided water bottles are quite nice for this). Make sure that you're clipping into something structural on a water bottle---that strip of plastic on a classic Nalgene bottle is just a leash to keep you from dropping the lid. Consider whether you will be climbing in the shade or sun and how hot and dry of a day it is (remember that these can change over the course of the day!). Consider sharing a water bottle if you won't need that much water on the route. On the topic of food and water, give some forethought to the other end as well. Try to take care of business before starting up the route (always follow Leave No Trace principles!). On some popular routes, this is such an issue that you can almost route find by sniffing your way to the next belay ledge... Rope Bag No. If you're climbing with a pack, you can just dump the rope in there. Otherwise, learn how to backpack coil a rope. Other Equipment Some people won't go anywhere without a knife, and they can potentially be useful for cleaning up tattered messes of webbing at anchors and dealing with stuck ropes...just no Vertical Limit moments! If you do carry a knife, chose something small and light, either stashing it in a pocket or clipping it off a harness. Consider something purpose built towards climbing like the Petzl Spatha , Trango Shark Nut Tool , or Buck Redpoint , and consider doing something to ensure the knife doesn't accidentally come open (a small wrap of climbing tape can work well). If you don't carry a knife, be aware that it is possible (if tedious) to cut a rope without a knife . Consider bringing some extra anchor material (~7mm cord or 9/16""--1"" webbing) and a few rap rings / mallions / leaver biners for improving rap stations. Try to avoid adding to ""rat nests"" by removing older tat if you feel its necessary to leave some of your fresher anchor material. Bring along a few extra pieces of climbing equipment in case effecting a self-rescue becomes necessary. An extra cordalette, a prusik/tibloc, and a couple extra carabiners can be miraculous with a little training and ingenuity. Route Information If possible, try to avoid carrying an entire guidebook up the route with you. Some options include taking a picture of the route description with a digital camera, photocopying the relevant pages, studying the route beforehand and committing the description and topo to memory, and even ripping the relevant pages out. This will also depend on the nature of the route, e.g., line of bolts vs trad route with intricate route finding. So how do I carry all this crap? Well, it depends on how much crap you're taking with you! From least amount of extra gear to most, the options would be If you only have a couple extra items, say approach shoes and a headlamp, just have everyone clip them to their harnesses. Have the follower climb with a small pack. A small lightweight pack or stripping down a climbing pack (remove top lid / framesheet / waistbelt) will work; clipping the waistbelt around the rear of the backpack can do wonders for making climbing and accessing harness gear loops easier. Consider keeping a few items clipped to the leader's harness to share the load. This works if you need, say, a couple liters of water, a few bars, headlamps, and a thin jacket each. Have a small leader's pack and larger follower's pack, perhaps by having a water bottle, headlamp, and jacket in each pack, with extra layers and shoes in the followers pack. Resort to hauling a pack or haulbag. A method of last resort as this ups the complexity and time taken, but can be necessary if the climbing is truly difficult. One special circumstance would be a route that is generally reasonable to climb with a pack, but features a crux off-width/chimney pitch. Rather than struggling to climb this one pitch with packs, consider hauling a pack through this section. It will definitely be more enjoyable and might even be faster. Other tips If doing a (long) walk-off descent without backpacks, consider loosening the leg loops on your harness (if possible) in order to make walking easier. Furthermore, try to shorten everything on your harness as much as possible--for example, re-rack cams off the thumb loop instead of the sewn sling. The cumulative effect will lead to less ""gear bounce"" as you walk and help reduce equipment getting hung up on bushes. When done with a climb, consider whether you brought enough extra gear and plan your next climb accordingly. Note that often times, the correct answer is ""learn to organize gear and move more efficiently"" rather than ""bring more stuff next time.""",small headlamp,0.351102769,3211,3225,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19172

It sounds ridiculous, but according to @Guran did happen, and it's not that hard to imagine. In many gyms the auto-belay is clipped to some kind of fabric attached to the wall, that will cover a section of the climb. Thus it's almost impossible to start climbing without first undoing this by clipping the auto-belay to ones harness. Correct attachment carabiner: Mostly specialized types that can't turn or open accidentally. In a well-run gym this is given (probably certifications apply, don't know about any such). Attachment point: Clip into the belay ring, not just the hip or leg loops or even gear loops (you never know). Malfunctioning: Test the auto-belay on first use by jumping down at a safe height. No helmet: I seem to recall a report about incidences with helmets catching while descending and thus incurring injuries. Climbing helmets are anyway not primarly designed to guard from banging your own head and thus generally not used in gyms. Fast climbing: You must not outpace the mechanism that pulls the auto-belay line/rope in. At least all systems I encountered are not designed to catch such a fall dynamically.

It's relatively easy to build if you have the right access to a stream. The basic idea behind this trap is to create a funnel that the fish follow into a trap that they cannot easily get out of. To build it, you simple stake off an area with small branches pushed down into the mud. The water must be able to get through, but make sure the sticks are close enough to prevent the fish from coming through. Notice in the picture that the bottom set of sticks creates a funnel that fish easily follow into the trap.

Some select tidbits to answer your question: All known scorpion species possess venom Of the 1000+ known species of scorpion, only 25 have venom that is dangerous to humans; most of those belong to the family Buthidae . First aid for scorpion stings is generally symptomatic. It includes strong analgesia, either systemic (opiates or paracetamol) or locally applied (such as a cold compress). Hypertensive crises are treated with anxiolytics and vasodilators. Unless you're an entomologist specializing in scorpions and you are damn sure the scorpion that stung you is not one of those dangerous to humans, you need to get medical attention ASAP. You probably won't have morphine or another opioid analgesic, but you might have a cold compress, so use it. As for vasodilators, you probably won't have any of them handy either, so, as I said, get to a hospital ASAP.

Based on my understanding, there is no length restrictions on folding knifes, as long as they are not considered to be a gravity knife or switchblade. The key point seems to be that there is no mechanical means of opening the blade, and that the blade has a tendency to stay close when in your pocket. Knives defined as daggers or dirks, must be open-carried and cannot be concealed but there does not seem to be any state wide law restricting size.

Electrically buffered needle Some lensatic needles are buffered with oil, which can leak. Radioactive "" Tritium "" powered illumination Do Not use a compass with Radium Easy to read bezel for night time bearings and triangulations. Stealth One of the great advantages to the lensatic compass is their use in night time navigation. The compass bezel is illuminated with a radioactive isotope. All modern lensatic compasses use Tritium , older compasses used to use Radium , but their use was linked to cancer, so don't use them. The radioactive tritium particles are low energy beta particles and are not harful for external use, (they cannot pass through clothing or skin). As long as you don't swallow them you are fine. The reason for the illumination is so that the compasses can be used without any external light source. The military, especially special forces, love this. It allows for ""dark"" navigation. Other information All radioactive isotopes have a half life. And Tritium's is 12 years, so in 12 years your compass will be half as bright as it is the day you bought it, then 12 years later, another half life. And so on. Links to other information...

1146,,What is a good starter kit for beginning indoor climbing?,Chalk and a chalk bag,"Shoes and a harness . Some places don't have belay devices or carabiners attached to each rope, so check on that beforehand, as you may need to provide your own. That's it. Chalk and a chalk bag is something you'll probably want pretty quickly and often comes packaged with the harness. For climbing shoes, look for something comfortable to wear for a couple hours but tight like a slipper. Imagine that you're going to be standing on your toes a lot, so you want a direct link from toe, to shoe, to wall. The same tightness should extend all around the toe box (i.e. gaps along your big toe or towards your smaller toes are bad). For a harness, just aim for comfort - you'll spend a lot of time hanging on the rope early in your climbing career, so a bit of padding won't hurt you. Lots of harnesses have a ton of ""gear loops"", but for indoor you can get the simplest one possible, just somewhere to hang your chalk bag, if that. Padded leg loops are worthwhile though, as is a simple way to get in and out of it, and an obvious way to check that you are properly strapped in. Belay device - hopefully they have a GriGri attached to each rope. If not, consider buying one if you can spare the cash. Otherwise, just get a simple ATC -style device and call it a day. In order to attach your belay device to your harness, you'll need a carabiner.

1152,,What are the tradeoffs for a Tomahawk over an Axe,weight you can carry,"Unfortunately the words ""Tomahawk"", ""Hand Axe"", ""Hatchet"", etc are not rigorously defined terms. If I wanted to make my own heavy blade attached to the end of a stick and sell it, I could use any of those terms. That said, typically a Tomahawk has a lighter head on a longer handle (and usually a smaller cutting surface, because it's a smaller head). A Hand Axe has a larger, and heavier, head on a shorter handle. A plain-jane axe has a heavy head on a much longer handle. As for trade-offs, it comes down to the weight you can carry, the type of cutting you need to do, and the accuracy with which you need to accomplish your task. I find any axe/hatchet/tomahawk with a lighter head and longer handle makes accurate cuts easier to make, while the heavier head on the shorter body allows for more powerful cuts, with the most powerful cut coming from a heavy head on a long handle (aka your typical axe). If you are showing off your axe throwing ability, a tomahawk (as defined in this answer) is better since it will spin less.

If there are a lot of crossings in a short distance I have shoes that I just wear for the entire hike. I'll cover both. General Rules Don't use rocks if you can avoid it. Stand on the bottom of the river. Just don't try rock hopping - you're asking for serious injury. (Yeah, I've done it too, without getting hurt, but it's a bad idea.) Use a hiking pole (or two) for added stability. Avoid funnels with rapid current. If you feel unstable then put your rainfly on your pack and float it or, at the least, unbuckle the belt so you can ditch it if you go under the water. When you step, wiggle your foot before putting weight on it. If it's slippery try a different footing. Barefoot Try to avoid stepping where you can't see. Do not go barefoot in high traffic areas that could have broken glass. Most river rocks aren't sharp, but use caution. Shoes If there are so many crossing that it's not practical to change, I just hike in shoes. Look for aerated shoes that will drain fast. Find something that's still a good fit. This will vary from person to person. It seems that everyone I meet uses something and swears by it and there is nothing else possibly better ever... Test first. I do this with places that allow returns. I put the shoes on with socks and hose them until soaked. Then I walk five miles. If my feet hurt, I return them. I do take care to not beat them up in that five miles. We do Jack's River here in GA every year. Last trip I used these and they worked amazingly well for 16+ river crossings in 8 miles.

1960,,What should I do if caught in a sand storm?,Cover yourself,"Sandstorms (or, here in the southwestern part of the US, dust storms) impair the ability to see and breath. The winds also carry heavier debris. Because the storms often occur when it is hot, the wind can contribute to dehydration. The reverse is also true--cold, winter dust storms occur in some places, and hypothermia can become an issue. Fortunately, most of the time, there is advance warning. Even if you don't hear the alert, you can see the wall of sand or dust moving your way. You don't want to be moving around during the storm, the potential for reduced visibility is great. Even if you are wearing goggles, there's a chance you won't be able to see where you are going. Bring your water canister and seek shelter--something sturdy. Even something that leaves you partially exposed will provide a degree of protection from sand/dust and debris. If shelter is not available, then a higher spot is often better than a lower simply because there is usually less particle density at the top of the storm. Move away from roads and freeways. In storms like this, drivers are advised to pull off the road, turn off their lights and keep their foot off the break. (Visibility can be so low that other drivers can't see the roadway. Terrible accidents occur because a driver mistook a car parked off the road with a car they thought was travelling on the road.) Cover yourself--arms, legs, neck, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, etc. Once you have yourself situated, then try to stay low to the ground and protect your head. There are related conditions of which you'll want to be aware. These storms are often accompanied by lightening and rain. Particularly in desert regions, the rain can cause flash flooding. You asked if the precautions can depend on the severity of the storm. Yes, the size and intensity of these storms vary greatly. When they are gathering steam, it's often not possible to distinguish the storm that has the potential to be more dangerous. Don't be misled, though--these storms are changeable and have the potential to become both fast moving and destructive.",Cover yourself,0.149308547,1365,1379,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1960

Yes, it is true a wet rope is actually weakened. But if it rains when you are sport climbing, you are probably just going to pull your rope and go home. A wet rope will regain all of its original characteristics once dry. Always do your research, read books, talk to lots of people, and practice!

To make it equally strong as it was before, you should Choose patch material not weaker than original material Choose nylon thread, which is NOT stronger, than both original and new materials (otherwise it will rip the weaker material like a knife). Sew together the two materials overlapped, avoid passing thread through 1 layer of the material (see #2). Usually more stitches of thiner thread is better than few stitches of thicker one (look at your harness where this principle is demonstrated in its extreme). The patch should obviously be bigger than the hole and maybe you'll want to overstitch the edges of both the hole and the patch to prevent them from raveling out.

Practice clipping techniques. Belay device: auto-locking (grigri) vs. standard friction device. Rope feeding technique, assessing slack in the system, when to feed out more slack and when to ""listen"" to the rope (e.g. be ready to catch a fall.) Lead belaying: feeding out rope, amount of rope to feed (slack), how to do it (see belay device,) belayer position and stance (safe location, ready to be yanked/jerked by sudden tension/pull due to a big fall), catching falls (work on soft/dynamic catch, possibly jumping), never letting go of the brake hand ( PBUS ), spotting until first bolt is clipped.

There are several water resistant down products, but they all work withing a small range of results with the same basic tech. Things to know: It's water resistant not water proof. For jackets this means you can probably withstand sweat and a light shower, but not a rainstorm. Down still loses its insulating properties when wet. Current water resistant techs don't change this, they just help prevent the down from getting wet. The best place for this is sleeping bags. This increases the chance that accidental exposure to rain (or other moisture) will not leave you without insulation at night.

The synthetic fiber content acts as a wick to pull the moisture away from your skin, while the mesh composition acts as a suspension system that increases airflow by maintaining separation between your skin/undershirt and the remainder of the garment. Additionally, the increased surface area of the mesh allows for greater air to moisture contact.

""Top-rope setup"" implies that someone else is going to climb the same route after you get down, right? Can anyone lay out all the typical steps...? Hang a locking karabiner (or a pair of non-locking quickdraws) on the anchor Clip your rope into it (don't forget to lock the karabiner) Tell your belayer that you are going to load the rope (we usually shout ""Take!"") Double-check your setup, then tell your belayer to lower you (we usually shout ""Down!"") Pick your quickdraws on the way down We sometimes omit step 4 in some very obvious situations (climbing with the same partner for months/years; easy and tedious routes) - I cannot recommend that to anyone, but I admit that we sometimes neglect that extra precaution. When you are done with the route, and want to retrieve your gear, the last person to climb must clean the route (see Liam's answer). What should have on my belt besides quickdraws? If you have 2 quickdraws at the end of your climb, it's enough. I usually also have a spare locking karabiner; I use it when quickdraws somehow don't fit (e.g. rubbing against a convoluted wall below the anchor, or karabiner gates catching on some protrusions and coming open). What etiquette issues are there? The classical dilemma is about hanging the top-rope on your gear vs hanging it on the fixed anchor: If you hang the top-rope on the fixed anchor, you don't leave any of your gear on the top. This is good because it leaves no room for error, and because whoever climbs with the top-rope doesn't feel obliged to get to the top of the route - one can give up, take the rope and go away. If you hang the top-rope on your gear, there will be much less friction applied to the fixed anchor, which will let it live longer (I heard it makes a huge difference with popular routes). What common problems arise, and how do you deal with them? If someone is top-roping and cannot get to the top, cleaning the route is problematic. One option is to have the climber pull himself on the rope - I cannot imagine a situation where one would fail to do this using a top-rope - maybe if extremely exhausted, or injured? A possible problem is when several parties want to climb the same route - either you climb the route another time to retrieve your gear or trust the last climber to clean the route properly (without accidentally falling down), and return your gear to you.",top-rope setup,0.331304729,78,92,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5465

6472,,What foods are unsafe to cook over an open fire?,raw brats,"Cooking raw brats over a fire is only dodgy because cooking brats well requires fairly precise (for a campfire) temperature control. Even with hot dogs, it can be a bit challenging to get the whole thing consistently cooked through without burning the outside. With a bratwurst, its larger size makes that especially difficult without some skill or tools. If you are skilled and patient, you can however cook them over a fire, just like with anything else. However, because of the extra challenge, fully cooked brats and sausages are better. If your fully cooked brats you bought could be eaten right out of the cold package, then you should be fine. As to pork vs other meats, pork was a bit more dangerous than beef because of Trichinosis , however to my knowledge in the developed world it is quite uncommon. This is probably why people in your group had that position. However, other common meats have plenty of other nasty critters in them, so it's debatable whether pork is actually any worse. Much of the danger of a particular meat today is not so much the animal it comes from, but from its preparation. Even chicken meat can be consumed raw if the animal was well cared for and kept free of disease. However, unless you've sourced your meat from a world-class shop, assume it is crawling with dangerous microbes that must be eradicated via cooking, because it almost surely is. Ultimately, all cooking involves the application of heat, so there is nothing that should not be cooked over a campfire, from a safety perspective.

A survival float -also know as a deadman float or jellyfish float ‚Äìis when you relax your body, over-inflate your lungs, and try to stay afloat using natural buoyancy by either laying out on your back or your front. On your front you obviously need to come up for air regularly, but on your back you can relax and just focus on your breathing and relaxing the cramp. I know people that are so buoyant they can actually fall asleep and take naps floating on their backs on lakes. A couple of summers ago I agreed to swim across a lake with my much more fit cousin. I tried keeping up with her for the first bit, but just past half way across I got a wicked cramp in my side. I was in the very middle of a lake so I had no choice but to keep on going. How I coped with the cramp was to first change my stroke (freestyle, to breast stroke, to side stroke, to back stroke). Eventually I had to stop kicking my legs and focus as hard as I could at relaxing the muscles where I was cramping. When the cramp got real bad, I ended up on my back in a survival float using gentle figure eight wrist motions to keep me moving towards shore. @Sherwood Botsford shared a very specific survival floating technique in the comments called drownproofing .

8730,,What is the most efficient way to position a reflector?,Simple geometry,"First of all, modern technology has eliminated the necessity of using campfires to stay warm at night with light weight tents and effective sleeping systems. There was a time when fires were almost a necessity in order to sleep comfortably in the cold, but nowadays they are only required in survival situations, and are actually frowned upon by people who practice Leave No Trace ethical camping. But, knowing how to construct an effective fire screen is still valuable knowledge to possess if you ever do find yourself in a survival situation. Reflectors were used to capture more of a fire's heat by reflecting what heat was being radiated away from your bed back into your open sleeping shelter. A more efficient reflector would obviously reflect as much of that radiating heat into your shelter as possible. In brief, the better your shelter is planned out, and the more time you dedicate to building it well, the more efficient your reflector is going to be. Your biggest enemy is going to be the wind, if you can't avoid setting up camp in a windy location, then you need to spend more time constructing a shelter which will protect against the wind, in the plains you can easily accomplish this by digging a pit shelter if it's feasible for you to do so and the ground is soft. If you have as many as four people, you could build four lean-tos in a closed square and all sleep around the fire, then the only heat that could escape the would be that which is going straight up. This basically emulates a teepee, which is also an extremely effective shelter for reflecting heat from a fire. Other tips for improving the efficiency of your wind screen would be to use more reflective materials such as tin foil, or a survival blanket, or by building screens in a semi-circle around the back and sides of your fire so no more heat is wasted. Simple geometry can even aid in improving efficiency, by angling your screen/s to more effectively direct the heat where you need it. The simplest way to make your screen more effective, is just to make it bigger. Walk around your shelter and your fire to see where the heat is radiating away from your bed and keep adding onto your reflector, or add more reflectors to direct more heat from your fire back into your shelter.",Simple geometry,0.242263034,1846,1861,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8730

9028,,What are the Pros and Cons of No-Cook Backpacking?,You have more time to spend doing other things,"I usually don't carry any kind of stove with me when I go hunting - this could be anytime from September to November or in May and early June. The weather can vary wildly during these times and I've experienced every kind of weather, from 10 below (F) and snow, to 30 degrees and freezing rain, to 90 (F) and dry. I found that going without hot food for up to a week is not a big deal - for me. That said, I prefer hot meals so, outside of a hunting/backpacking trip, I put more effort into my meals. The pros of not cooking while backpacking: You have more time to spend doing other things. Meal preparation time can vary, for example, boiling water for some quick oatmeal is much quicker than making enchiladas or wild strawberry pie in a dutch oven (yes, I have known two backpackers that carry small dutch ovens and eat like kings). But still, it takes time to open your pack, set up your cooking gear, cook the meal, clean up, and repack. If you are busy doing other things, such as hiking or watching wildlife in the evening, then maybe this is a chore that should be eliminated. Not taking cooking gear reduces weight and gives you extra space in your pack for other things. However, this might be cancelled by the increased bulk and weight of the food itself, mentioned in con #6 below. Preparing your meals so that you can eat all day means you will be less hungry . Instead of having two or three big meals and a couple snacks, you can simply eat whenever you feel like it. Often, I feel a lot better when I simply snack all day. Buying a stove, and cookwear, and the just-add-water meals can get expensive. Not buying them and preparing simple foods at home can save a good deal of money . The cons of not cooking while backpacking: Cooking in the mountains can be very enjoyable. Planning not to cook eliminates an enjoyable activity (although cooking in downpours and high winds can be very frustrating). You might need a hot meal. A hot meal can really perk you up at the end of a long day when you're tired, or maybe feeling a little homesick. Your choices of foods/meals are a bit limited , which dampens the whole outdoor experience, unless your trip is a short one, or if you can conquer #4. To eat healthy while not cooking, you need to be more creative . Coming up with a list of foods that you can (and will) eat can be daunting if you aren't used to, or you don't enjoy, creating healthy menus. Unprepared . If you find that you do want to cook a meal (do you fish?), you will need to resort to using a campfire which may not be allowed at some places and times (some parks, fire season, etc.). Foods that are ready to eat are generally bulkier and heavier . Just imagine a couple peanut butter sandwiches next to a cup of uncooked rice. By the way, I don't advise carrying peanut butter sandwiches beyond day #1 :) Even when I backpack without typical cooking gear, I'm still prepared to make an emergency meal in case my body temperature gets too low or I simply want or need something hot. For this, I carry a stainless steel cup and a couple packets of tea and a small ziploc or two of quick oats and sugar (don't forget a spoon!). Of course, if and when I use these, a fire is then required. Just as a side note here, since you mentioned ""non-winter conditions"": if you intend on backpacking in the Rocky Mountains, be prepared for cold weather at any time of the year. On July 27, this year, here in eastern Idaho, we had a couple inches of hail in the lower areas and snow in the mountains. Two days later, although the weather was beautiful and in the 70's, I found 4 inches of snow still covering the trail, in places, on a section of the Continental Divide Trail.

9355,,What is the difference between accessory cord and prusik cord?,15.6 kN rating,"Based on the picture the OP presents, the yellow prusik cord weave has each pair of threads (likely not the correct term) passing over 3 or 4 threads rather than two. This doubling of length and corresponding reduction of crossing points seems likely to make the cord more flexible than the orange cord, a feature that will assist in making the tight wraps of a prusik or similar friction knot. In actual climbing use I don't know of anything that would preclude using one in favor of the other for a given diameter or cord. The strength differences between different brands also vary far more than the differences between the two types of cord. BlueWater Ropes sells both accessory and prusik cord in a variety of thicknesses. There seems to be a negligable decrease in specified strength for the ""prusik"" cord, also seen below in the Sterling cords. The product photos show a similar difference in weave as that seen in the OP's image. BlueWater says: These use specific cords have a firm, yet supple hand and will hold higher loads before slippage than do traditional accessory cords. Sterling Rope sells 8mm cord in both ""accessory"" and ""prusik"" cord variations.

9765,,What are other possible make-shift alternatives for chalk powder?,plain water,"A few years back at my University climbing gym, someone posted a study performed on chalking your hands while climbing. Basically, it was discovered that there was actually a measurable decrease in the coefficient of friction when you used chalk. As in, chalk made climbing holds harder to hang onto. This of course made all the climbers who read the abstract laugh, because every climber knows that chalk helps you hang on to slippery holds. But after reading the study I was actually convinced. Chalk will soak up all your sweat and grime and dry your hands, but clean dry hands are actually gripper than chalked hands. In fact, according to this study, even wet clean hands have a stronger coefficient of friction than chalked hands. The conclusion of the study was that climbers would be better off using plain water instead of chalk. It's the oils produced by your skin that makes rock holds slippery, and water naturally displaces oil, whereas chalking you hands puts a fine powder between you and the hold. Whether or not you have chalk, the science says you're better off washing your hand in water. I've yet to try it (mostly because the rock I climb is so dirty I don't even need chalk) but you could try climbing with a wet sponge in your chalk bag and a golf towel hanging off your harness to wash and dry your hands with when they get grimy.",plain water,0.071756676,809,820,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9765

Those axes are hand forged and during the process oxides build up on the surface of the metal and if flakes of scale get picked up on the head of the hammer (probably a power hammer in this case) they can get driven into the surface of the steel making a shallow indent. You can also get texture where the scale falls off in some places but not others. Axes are pretty overbuilt in terms of material thickness so shallow indents like this on the surface won't make any difference to its performance, strength or durability, especially considering that the stamping is a lot deeper than those pits. A lot of the steel in an axe head is there to make up weight and provide the correct geometry, in fact in many traditional styles use a 3 layer laminated construction with the bulk of the head made up by wrought iron or mild steel to economise on tools steel which was, historically, very expensive.",flakes of scale get picked up on the head of the hammer,0.236643672,135,190,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11470

The packets contain finely powdered magnesium metal, alloyed with a small amount of iron, and table salt. Adding a small amount of water results in a salt-water electrolyte fluid that allows the magnesium and iron to rapidly react and generate heat. The standard use is to place the food packet inside a bag along with the heater packet, then add a small amount of water. The top of the bag is folded over, the bag is held level to allow the heater to soak up water, and finally the bag is placed back in the carton and left at a slight incline while the food warms. Note: Per the instructions, you should not drink the water or use it in food items. Also, the reaction produces hydrogen gas, so be cautious of breathing the fumes or using it in a confined space or near open flames. The packets weigh about 1.5oz each and are single-use, so it's usually more efficient to use traditional cooking methods (alcohol, isobutane canisters, etc.) for trips that will require more than one hot meal. ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameless_ration_heater",flameless ration heaters,0.06195467,80,104,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11474

Amendment: The lead warning on the box is referring to the primer compound (lead styphnate). Dinitrotoluene could be used in either the primer or powder.

11803,,What is the difference between a rifle and a shotgun?,rifles are accurate and effective at much greater ranges,"The term 'rifle' comes from the fact that the barrel of a rifle has spiral grooves (called rifling) cut into the inside. When the bullet is fired it is forced into these grooves which in turn cause it to spin as it travels down the barrel. This spin around its long axis creates a gyroscopic effect which stabilises it in flight dramatically improving its accuracy and the consistency of its trajectory. This axial stabilization also means that the bullet can be made with a more aerodynamically efficient shape (typically a cone or cylinder) as it is much less prone to tumbling end over end in flight. A consequence of this is that a rifle bullet is a tight fit in the barrel and so very little of the gas pressure generated by the propellant can get past it compared to a shotgun and so typically a rifle requires a rather heavier barrel than a shotgun as it must contain greater gas pressures even though a shotgun shell may have a greater mass of propellant. A shotgun is designed to produce a spread of shot over short to moderate ranges which makes it easier to hit small fast moving targets, such as small game and especially birds in flight. the limitation is that its stopping power and accuracy decrease quickly with range. In a military context shotguns have the advantage that they have high stopping power at very short ranges, can hit a target without careful aim* and have a very versatile selection of rounds for different purposes. They are also particular useful for breeching unarmored doors either with buckshot, solid slugs or specialist breeching rounds there are also specialist rounds for firing gas and pyrotechnic munitions through light doors and walls as well as for shattering windows (relatively) safely. *In response to comments I will clarify this point by adding that shotguns are well suited to quickly acquiring and hitting fast moving targets of opportunity both because of their spread pattern and general handling characteristics. Here 'careful aim' was perhaps the wrong choice of words but the point is that they work well for reflexive type shooting styles both in the context of game shooting (eg birds flying from cover) and certain military contexts. This is especially the case over moderate ranges in close terrain (eg dense forest or outdoor urban terrain) shotguns may be a very effective weapon as an initial counter to ambushes or unexpected contact with the enemy at short range. Solid slugs in shotguns are normally primarily intended as anti-material rounds for use against light vehicles etc at fairly close range but they can also be used to improve effective range and accuracy against personnel. Solid slugs are also commonly the only allowed munition for hunting large game on public land. Rifle rounds travel very far before hitting the ground due to their high muzzle velocity relative to shotgun slugs, so they are more dangerous in the case of a miss. Buckshot is typically banned on public land as it doesn't group reliably and stray pellets can go on long and magical journeys into the woods. Pump action shotguns also have the advantage that a single round can be loaded and fired very quickly from an unloaded weapon. For all of these reasons shotguns are often used as primary or additional weapons by at least one member of units specializing in close quarters, urban or hostage rescue. In contrast rifles are accurate and effective at much greater ranges. Although shot rounds for rifles do exist they are pretty rare.",rifles are accurate and effective at much greater ranges,0.259107053,3368,3424,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11803
11828,,What does lumen and lux for flashlights/torches actually mean?,how much light hits a particular area,"From a related post : Lumens is the SI unit for luminous flux, which is essentially the total amount of light in the visible spectrum emitted by a source in all directions. Lumens does not depend on distance from the light source, because it must be measured in all directions. A related unit, lux, measures the amount of light hitting a certain surface area, and is dependent on distance. 1 lux = 1 lm/m 2 . If you were to measure the lux on every surface of an imaginary sphere around a light source and add it up, you would get the total lumens output of the device. No matter what the diameter of the sphere, you would get the same number of lumens. As you increase the diameter, the brightness on any given surface is lower, but the surface area you must measure increases. It turns out this is almost exactly how you measure lumens in real life - with a scientific instrument called an integrating sphere . An integrating sphere uses a highly diffuse coating to evenly disperse light inside a sphere. All light entering through the sample port bounces around so many times that the brightness is nearly even at any point on the surface of the sphere. A photodetector, typically a radiometer, measures the intensity of the light received at the exit port across all visible wavelengths, then sums the intensities to determine the total luminous flux. Below is a photo of the integrating sphere I used to conduct testing of bike lights: Lux can be measured with a low-cost hand-held light meter. Of course, an accurate and calibrated meter costs more. Lux is lm/m 2 ; in other words, how much light hits a particular area. Lux meters collect light from an aperture of a known size, typically about 1 in 2 . You state that: The lux number is conceptually easier, as it does not require a point source and could be measured at any point of the light beam. However it probably is along the central beam axis. Lux does depend on position, because it's light per area . The further you get from the light source the more the light beam has diffused, so the less light hits a particular area, as illustrated by this drawing from Wikipedia: Candela is the unit for a point measurement which doesn't depend on the distance. Candelas are inversely proportional to the square of lux. You can convert lux to candela using the inverse square law: candela = lux * (d)^2 where d is the distance in meters from the light source. Is there an agreed upon position/method to measure these values (in between manufacturers)? Yes, there is. The ANSI FL1 Standard was developed by the flashlight industry in 2009 and specifies particular measurement techniques and testing conditions. The standard includes test methods for beam distance (derived from lux), peak beam intensity (candelas at the center/brightest spot of the beam), battery run time, light output, and other features like impact resistance and water resistance. It also specifies standard icons and marketing guidelines to ensure consistent information is available to consumers. Here is a summary of the markings and their associated meanings, from Streamlight: Not all manufacturers follow the FL1 standard, although most reputable ones do. Some have their own testing process which is similar, while others simply make up numbers to sound good so they can sell lots of crappy products to poorly informed consumers. Certainly be skeptical of outrageous claims, especially if the product doesn't have FL1 Standard markings on the packaging or website. Also, note that device characteristics can significantly affect actual output compared to specifications. In particular: Losses from internal reflection, passing through lenses, and other factors of the optical design can significantly reduce the useful light output compared to the raw output from the LED emitter. Higher quality lights typically use more expensive optical glass and carefully design their reflectors to minimize these losses. Cheap products use simple plastic. The FL1 Standard requires testing the fully assembled light, but some less honest manufacturers will publish the emitter lumens rating rather than the actual useful light levels. LEDs get less efficient as they get warm. Lights with poor thermal management will get dimmer as you use them. This is typically not reflected in the specifications, but is sometimes brought up in independent reviews. Batteries and circuitry within the light play a big role too. As a battery drains down, its voltage drops. At lower voltages, LEDs put out less light. Good lights have voltage regulators to keep the brightness up even when the battery gets low, and to step the brightness down only once the battery can no longer supply enough voltage even with the regulator. Other lights will just get dimmer through the runtime. There are also an increasing number of counterfeit LEDs now. Cree is the most well-known LED manufacturer and has the highest performing LEDs. A lot of very cheap generic lights advertised as containing Cree LEDs actually have knock-offs which don't work as well. Worse yet, rechargeable lithium batteries included in many cheap lights are often unsafe and rarely have the capacity advertised.",how much light hits a particular area,0.189683497,1588,1625,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11828

In contrast to a pedometer, which counts for you, you have to mentally keep count of the paces you take; there is nothing automatic about it. This article tells you how to make your own. The article calls the device Ranger Beads and says they were originally developed by the military. Wikipedia tells you how to use the device. The tool is usually constructed using a set of 13 beads on a length of cord. The beads are divided into two sections, separated by a knot. 9 beads are used in the lower section, and 4 or more beads are used in the upper section. There is often a loop in the upper end, making it possible to attach the tool to the user's gear with a simple Larks head hitch. How to use There are two ways to use the beads. One is to represent the paces the user has walked, while the other is to represent the distance walked. Both methods requires the user to know the relationship between the paces walked and the distance travelled. Counting paces As users walk, they typically slide one bead on the cord for every ten paces taken. On the tenth pace, the user slides a bead in the lower section towards the knot. After the 90th pace, all 9 beads are against the knot. On the 100th pace, all 9 beads in the lower section are returned away from the knot, and a bead from the upper section is slid upwards, away from the knot. In this manner, the user calculates distance travelled by keeping track of paces taken. To use this method, the user must know the length of his pace to accurately calculate distance travelled. Also, the number of paces to be walked must be precalculated, or the distance travelled has to be calculated from the walked paces. Distance walked For every 100 metres the user walks, one of the lower beads is pulled down. When the ninth of the lower beads is pulled, the user has walked 900 metres. When the user has walked 1000 metres, one of the upper beads is pulled down, and all the lower beads are pulled back up. Using this method the user must know the number of paces walked in 100 metres. An experienced user can also adapt the pace count for each hundred metres depending on the terrain. When using this method the user does not have to calculate or look up how long a distance to walk or the distance travelled.","a low-tech, manually operated",0.100492835,18,47,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14417

They checked how much they needed to break the rope and give a tick of pass or not pass. If they all passed, they take the batch as a good and give them the warm and fuzzy seal of approval. If they don't pass they will take that whole batch aside and check what's wrong. That's roughly the process. What do the UIAA markings on my climbing hardware really mean? The UIAA markings are the minimum requirements for the gear to get the warm fuzzy UIAA seal of approval from the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinism (International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation) . The manufacturer would have a number of tests to match the UIAA (in this case) requirements. Other manufacturers might want other seals and have extra/other sets of requirements for that too. So when they pick some samples and run tests, these tests are to match the UIAA seal. A few points about QA and certifications Smaller the number of pieces in a batch, better the QA control. It's easier to have a better quality gear if two in a batch of 10 pass then if 10 in a batch of 100 and so on. The better brand is not the one the gear doesn't break. It's the one the gear break the least. If 1 piece in 10 breaks is better than 6 in 10. So we just hope we don't get that faulty one. :) (Of course I'm exaggerating here a bit to emphasize my point. Climbing gear has a very high quality standard and I would expect more like 1 in thousands for the crap brand really).",the minimum requirements,0.289454669,1080,1104,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14559

When you're climbing soft ice, you don't want to cut through it, you want it to support your foot so you can you stand on it.

Vertical points are great for sticking into hard waterfall ice, but they will rip right through softer ice and snow like a knife. When hiking non-technical ice, horizontal points are the better choice. It's these style of crampons that all high altitude mountaineers wear when climbing mountains like Everest: I personally have a pair of both, but I've hiked on spring snow and ice with people who were wearing vertical front points, and have watched their feet rip through the ice in spots where my foot placements didn't move in my horizontal front point crampons.

For example, I'm currently riding a pair of light camber 190's 130,95,110mm in the back country. They are excellent on the flat and on the ascent, and they keep me afloat when skinning, but they're a bit fast for my liking when I'm skiing glades, and they're a bit tough to keep my tips up. I know now that I would prefer to ride a shorter ski with more rocker, maybe even full rocker since I mostly ski off-piste. Since I'm going shorter I probably also want to go wider, since I don't want to lose any of the float my longer skis give me when skinning. Until you understand how different styles of skis perform, and where you like to perform, then what type of ski you get is very subjective. The skis you've picked out sound like an excellent choice, and after skiing on them for a while you'll begin to recognize whether they're adequate for what you're doing or whether you need to switch to something else after a couple seasons for whatever advantage you feel you want from your skis.

15701,,What are the dangers of walking barefoot in towns/cities?,frostbite,"My family walks around barefoot all the time, not just in the summer. We used to live in Santa Clara County, California, but now live in Humboldt County of the same state. We've never had any serious problems and I would not discourage from doing this but there are several disadvantages: By far the biggest disadvantage is that you will face significant judgment and discrimination . While walking barefoot you people will move to the other side of the street, sneer, shout things like ""get some shoes"", etc. Not everyone does this and outright aggression happens a lot more to the young women in my family than to me (I'm kinda big, they are really small), but it's a pretty serious concern. This doesn't just apply to strangers on the street, either-- expect to be refused service at many grocery stores, restaurants, and other places of business. Even public places in the wealthier parts of towns often have security that will lie to and threaten you to get/force you to leave if you are not wearing shoes. With regard to businesses, you will be told that ""It's against the Health Code for us to allow customers without shoes in the bulding"". That's, like, the number 1 reason given when they kick you out. It's also not true (the Health Code prohibits employees from not wearing shoes in certain occupations in certain regions, but neither area I have lived in have forbidden customers from not wearing shoes). Anyways, the harassment can be a real bother; be ready for it. In the snow, it gets really cold. During the winter, sometimes it snows. Walking in the snow barefoot is alright for a little bit if your feet are used to it, but you risk frostbite if you're out long. If there's snow and ice on the ground, you should wear shoes or limit your time outside. Feet washing is still important if you walk around barefoot. On the plus side, you are much less likely to get most common foot diseases and your feet will smell nice because they aren't in a moist, sweaty, warm, dark environment all the time. On the downside, your feet won't start to smell bad so you might not wash them as thoroughly as you otherwise would. Basically, just remember to wash. The other barefoot issue is that if you step in something gross with shoes you can take your shoes off before entering the house and washing them. I find that it's far more difficult to take my foot off before entering the house! Avoid walking in terrain where you can't see what you're stepping on/in. This applies to things like tall grass and dense ferns or ivy. Since you can't see, you have no way to prevent yourself from stepping in something gross, like animal poop, or even something dangerous, like trash. This actually applies even when you are wearing shoes-- walking through such things damages the plants involved (less meaningfully in the case of grass) and exposes you to wild animal related risks like ticks . It may still be worth it to you, at various points in time, to partake in barefoot activities in grassy or otherwise groundcovered areas, but you should try to be aware of the risks and decide on a case by case basis. Personally, walking through tall grass barefoot makes me uncomfortable, so I don't do it unless I absolutely have to. No one in my family routinely walks through areas where you can't see what you're stepping in, so, while we haven't had any problems with this besides the occasional, really-gross-but-harmless stepping-in-dog-poop accident, I can't really speak to an overall risk assessment for your off-trail barefoot walking habits. On-trail and on streets in town you should be able to avoid doing this. This doesn't apply to you at all, since you've been doing this for years, but if you haven't walked around barefoot before you may not be aware that it hurts. Concrete is rough and hard and will sand down your skin, which means that, until you build up callouses, your feet will start to hurt after walking around for just a bit. As your feet get tougher, it hurts less or not at all, but there's always more terrain that your feet will need to adapt to. Pine needle mats hurt until your feet get tough (then they can feel good instead-- very squishy XD ), gravel hurts always even with crazy rediculous feet (as far as I'm aware), concrete will always hurt if you walk on it long enough to sand down the callouses, but at some point that's no longer a feasible amount of time to walk. This isn't a danger, though, so much as it is unpleasant, unless you end up needing to run away from something else dangerous while barefoot and don't have enough callouses yet to support that. Broken glass, nails, needles, etc are not real problems. We've never had any serious issues with that. It's true the streets are dirty sometimes, but you don't go tromping around in the gutter or over broken glass barefoot, and it's not like you end up doing those things on accident. The danger of that sort of thing happening is exaggerated in the minds of the community, possibly to disguise their more classist motivations for discriminating against the lack of shoes from themselves (see problem with walking barefoot #1). Hookworms have been brought up enough times in comments to be addressed directly.

The thing that looks like a biner between the columns is indeed a biner, probably from an ice/snow anchor. The holes (especially the large one) are due to this biner. What happens is that when the leader requires slack and pulls the rope up, the friction between the rope and the columns before the biner is extremely one-directional: the biner forces the rope to run in an almost fixed angle theta from the belay. Every climber has seen this happen: you place a quickdraw and then the route has a horizontal traverse, and then when it gets vertical again you feel a lot of friction and look down - what you see is the rope being constricted by that quickdraw that preceded the traverse. The friction is mainly due to the normal force the rope creates against that biner, but in this case you also have a lot of friction against the columns before the quickdraws (since they're protruded and pass in front of the rope's way). I've sketched some draws: Front view: From above: Column 1 (and the ones before it also) is the one that will experience the most unidirectional (mostly horizontal) rope slippage, and will acquire holes due to it. Column 2 will also suffer similar effects, because after the anchor the rope's movement is also unidirectional. The following columns will have no holes, since the rope has again a free angle to move until the leader places another anchor - that is, the rope will dangle and scatter the snow in a uniform manner. This is in agreement with the picture and the video I attached shows pretty clearly that the quickdraw moves up and then, when it reaches a maximum angle, the rope is constricted to move in a single direction. After some meters I'm pretty sure the little hole it opens at each time it does that is already large enough for it to enter it completely. Edit 1: the situation where the holes are inevitably dig is quite possibly when the leader ends the pitch and begins retrieving the excess rope for the second climber to come. This creates constant, fast rope action against the columns.

Yanking on an object can stimulate serious bleeding and damage underlying structures, especially if the object is impaled in a body cavity , such as the chest, abdomen or head ... The object should be stabilized with padding to prevent movement. The padding should be as high as the object to protect it from being bumped during transport and the patient should be carried out. In many cases there is nothing easy about getting to help and impaled objects sometimes make evacuation very difficult. Removal of impaled objects in the wilderness is an oft-debated subject. They are often difficult to stabilize over rough terrain. Page 107 Wilderness First Responder -Buck Tilton, MS, WEMT With any abdominal injury anticipate nausea and vomiting. Over time blood may appear in the vomit (often looking like coffee grounds), in the urine (often appearing pale pink), or in the stool (often described as black and tarry), depending on where the damage occurred. Over time a fever may develop. ... Stay alert to the possiblity of vomiting. Generally treat for shock. ... If evacuation is delayed and the patient is alert, the patient may be given clear fluids to drink, as long as she or he tolerates the fluids. ... The immediate seriousness of any penetrating abdominal cavity , as with blunt trama, is determined by what got damaged inside and how badly its bleeding. With severe bleeding, shock is imminent and immediate evacuation is the only chance of salvation. Over time the risk of infection is very high. ... External bleeding should be controlled. Wounds should be cleaned and bandaged... Impaled objects, in almost all cases should be stabilized in place.

18420,,What is the difference between single and double action revolvers?,the trigger pull is much heavier,"TDLR : Single actions only fire the revolver, double actions both cock the hammer and fire. The way that revolvers work is that each time it is fired, the cylinder must be rotated and the hammer cocked so that it can be dropped onto the primer to fire the bullet. To do this with a single action revolver the user has to manually cock the hammer back before pulling the trigger while pulling the trigger on a double action revolver cocks the hammer and then fires the revolver by dropping the hammer onto the primer. The downside of not having to manually cock the hammer with a double action is that the the trigger pull is much heavier and that leads one to be less accurate. Most double action revolvers however do have the ability to manually cock the hammer for extra accuracy. Double action revolvers that lack the ability to manually cock the hammer are called double action only . In addition there are a few double action revolvers such as the Webley‚ÄìFosbery Automatic Revolver where the recoil is used to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer to avoid the heavy trigger pull.",the trigger pull is much heavier,0.127400264,605,637,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18420
18488,,What are the steps in the PBUS method of belaying?,B for Brake,"P for Pull One hand holds the rope above belay device and the other below. During this step the hand above pulls down while at the same time the lower hand pulls the rope through the belay device. B for Brake During the above step, it is not always possible to keep the lower hand behind the braking plane, especially on lower angle climbs. During this step, you want to make certain that the lower hand is behind the braking plane. U for Under During this step, the upper hand reaches down, underneath of the lower hand to hold the rope in preparation of the next step, slide. S is for Slide During this step the upper hand holds the brake strand while the lower slides back up the rope in preparation to start the process over again. After this the upper hand goes back to the top to restart. Two things to note, people will say that this is safer than the slip-slap-slide method, and they are usually right, but you have to watch the braking plane. Doing the PBUS style and yet having the lower/brake hand in front of the braking plane is dangerous as you have no friction. DON'T DO THIS The other thing is that while the PBUS method works really well for sport or indoor climbing when the climber is above at a steep angle, it gets harder and hard to keep the brake hand behind the braking plane when the angle is less steep or if you are belaying someone from below you. That is why it is worth it to know both PBUS and the slip-slap-slide technique , especially if you are ever doing a body belay which basically mandates the slip-slap-slide technique .",B for Brake,0.044202048,197,208,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18488

20040,,What is the survival rate for fish restocked via airplane?,over 85 percent,"The web site UtahFishFinder claims a 99% survival rate (assuming the fish hit the water). I presume height of drop could influence it. They drop the fish anywhere between 50 and 150 feet: Once he's over the desired lake, the pilot evaluates his approach and exit, plane speed, windage and altitude, and lines up with the lake. While over the lake, he triggers one or more of the toggle switches on the plane's instrument panel. This opens the compartments, allowing the water and fish to drop into the lake below. The fish fall between 50 to 150 feet, depending on how close to the lake the pilot can fly. Because of their small size, this process of dropping doesn't hurt the fish (it's like a high diver diving into a deep pool of water). The survival rate of these fish is around 99 percent. At Glenn Air Alaska they fly higher, up to 250 feet. The survival rate is nearly the same, at 98 percent: Years ago, Glenn and Martinek had the hatchery crew videotape the aerial operation and learned that dropping the fish from 250 feet produced a 98 percent survival rate. ""Two-hundred-and-fifty feet is just right,"" Glenn said. ""The water atomizes. The fish are in the air just long enough to orient themselves so that they hit the water head first and not long enough that the freefall dries out their gills."" In contrast, the Western Canadian Game Warden , do not specify a drop height. The success rate in their studies is over 85 percent: The Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) stocks native cutthroat trout in high altitude lakes with airplanes. Four specialized pilots fly modified Cessna 185 airplanes and stock around 300 lakes ranging in altitude from 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Several hundreds or even thousands of fish are dropped at a time. The airplane is equipped with a custom built trout tank, named ‚ÄúBass-O-Matic‚Äù. DOW studies show that over 85 percent of the tiny fish actually survive the fall. The Airplane Owners and Pilots Association published a piece on Maine Game Wardens, indicating Department biologists using scuba gear have had trout dropped around them and observed as the fish hit the water and swam away. The biologists report that most of the trout easily survive their aerial drop without injury or harm. (I'm not sure I'd volunteer to be under a fish drop, but it would be an experience.) Compared with loading the fish up on mules, like in the old days, the shorter plane hop to high alpine lakes likely means fewer fish die on the way, more than making up for any losses during the drop. Edit - the BBC has just posted a video of a drop by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

20143,,What makes some of the lakes in the Himalayas saline?,The salt that is carried down by the precipitation,"In all of these cases it's because they are Endorheic , which is a fancy way of saying that they have inputs but no outputs. The salt that is carried down by the precipitation is trapped in the lake with no where to go and so over time, the lakes become saline. Endorheic lakes are usually in the interior of a landmass, far from an ocean in areas of relatively low rainfall. Their watersheds are often confined by natural geologic land formations such as a mountain range, cutting off water egress to the ocean. The inland water flows into dry watersheds where the water evaporates, leaving a high concentration of minerals and other inflow erosion products. Over time this input of erosion products can cause the endorheic lake to become relatively saline (a ""salt lake""). Endorheic lakes Salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake, containing salt or minerals, cannot leave because the lake is endorheic (terminal). The water then evaporates, leaving behind any dissolved salts and thus increasing its salinity, making a salt lake an excellent place for salt production. Salt Lakes Freshwater does contain a little salt, eroded from rocks and soil. Even though salt constantly washes into freshwater lakes, it also flows out at the same time , eventually making its way into the ocean. The Great Salt Lake is different from other inland lakes because it has no outlets to the ocean. Three rivers empty into the lake, but the only way water can exit the lake is by evaporation. When water evaporates out of the lake, it leaves most of its salt behind, just like in the ocean. In fact, the chemistry of the Great Salt Lake is similar to the ocean, except that it‚Äôs even saltier.

For competition purposes the difference between canoeing and kayaking is how you propel the boat. This appears to be the factor that's causing you confusion. There are various competitive classes of canoeing and kayaking, most of them have 3 parts to the name. Discipline: Sprint, Slalom, Polo, Rodeo etc. Those are fairly self explanatory and I won't go into them. And you get a letter and a number e.g. K1 or C2. The letter is whether it's canoe or kayak. The number is the number of people in the boat. C1 has 1 person canoeing, K4 has 4 people kayaking. The only technical difference between a canoe and a kayak is how you paddle it: A kayak is paddled seated, feet forward, with a double bladed paddle. A canoe is paddled kneeling, one knee for sprint otherwise on both knees, with a single bladed paddle. If you wish to convert your kayak into a canoe, you take out the seat and fit a saddle. Competition boats are usually harder to modify as they're fundamentally built to be one or the other, but white water boats with larger cockpits are easily swapped back and forth. There is another classification that mostly used for recreational canoeing rather than for competition. OC - Open Canoe This covers your more familiar ""Canadian"" style canoes where 1-3 people can be seated on thwart seats with single blade paddles.

Note that my burner is quite a bit smaller and simpler than a Trangia, and I don't suggest applying my results blindly to a stove with any form of jets or a bigger cup. Testing a different under controlled conditions would be a good idea before relying on this. The flashpoint and autoignition temperature of the various fuels didn't seem to be a good predictor of how useful they'd be. The stove was built for meths (UK composition denatured alcohol), and this was indeed the best fuel. Various others will work to some extent, though I wouldn't plan for them. If I did, I'd restrict the burner diameter. A spreadsheet with the results is on Google docs , but they're summarised below. Acetone worked quite well. ""Pure"" acetone is available with the nail polish removers in some shops (or my regular supermarket stocks 98% as extra strong nail polish remover). This is probably the best fallback but the flames did escape a bit. Isopropanol and methanol are probably harder to get hold of than meths, at least in the UK. Of these, methanol is cleaner-burning. I suspect that an acetone-free remover with fewer ingredients would work quite nicely. The one I used was a fancy brand touting the benefits of vitamins and chamomile extract. These are based on ethyl acetate. The cheap acetone-based nail polish remover I used had too much water to be very useful. My experiment used a home-made open-cup burner. The burner, made from a mixer-size aluminium can, is about 50 mm across. The top of the burner is around 40 mm below the bottom of the steel mug, but the fuel was about 20 mm lower (I can easily cook noodles or porridge with meths to 10 mm below the top). The ambient temperature was 18¬∞C. The final water temperatures may be a little high as I used an IR thermometer (I don't have a normal thermometer covering that range). I used 10 ml of each fuel, and 200 ml of fresh cold water each time. For anyone considering replicating this: I had long matches for lighting, was on concrete well away from anything flammable, and had the means to smother any excessive flames.

A side note on weight is that the lighter your pack overall, the happier your back. A lot of the packing order depends on your particular pack, but in general, the bottom of a pack is below your hips. Therefore, it is best to put something big and light in the bottom. A fleece is one idea, or your sleeping bag (if it's down, might be less great if synthetic due to the amount of crushing that will happen). Now that we have the level of stuff above your hips, heavy things go next, right against your back. I like to put my food bag on one side and the tent on the other. Down the middle, cooking gear, maps, books, etc. If there is room left away from your back, stuff your sleeping pad and random clothes. On the top all this stuff, put whatever light items you have left (i.e. repair kits, first aid kit, rain jacket). The key to this idea is that your heavy things are silo-like, i.e. tightly packed stuff sacks.

(That being said, I'm a big fan of my straight edge SOG SEAL Pup Elite and would highly recommend it). There are a few simple guidelines, though. I'd suggest something with a (1) thick full-tang blade , so you could chop down some small trees if needed. But (2) not too big , so it's still comfortable for carving fire spindles and whatnot. (3) Straight edge is better than serrated - you're unlikely to need to skin a bear in a survival situation, but carving with the serrated blade is a pain. Serrated blade is also not very easy to sharpen. And remember, the best knife is the knife you have on your person when you need it.

This may seem like a long list, but it's small . It fits in a ziploc bag (almost). Also, please note that you should pack for your skill set and first aid training. If you don't know how to use a splint, it's wasted and will tempt you to do things you shouldn't. Same goes for sutures. Know how benedryl and the epipen work before you dose anyone. You get the idea. Tylenol -- pain where ibuprofen is not ok (ie - patient is bleeding) Ibuprofen -- pain that involves swelling but not bleeding Small bandages -- comfort item and to help prevent infection on longer hikes Triple Antibiotic -- reduce risk of infection Iodine -- wound care, reduces risk of infection Medical Tape -- close wounds Gauze -- for use covering wounds and to stop bleeding Latex Gloves -- They weigh nothing, sometimes you don't have time to wash (get nitrile if you or your hiking buddies have a latex allergy) SAM Splint -- breaks and sprains, better than improvising one Benedryl -- mild reactions EpiPen -- serious reactions. One of the few things you will NOT make it out of the woods with is an anaphylactic shock reaction without an epipen or something equally powerful. Basic Suture stuff -- dire emergencies only Quick Clot patch (antibacterial) -- slows/stops bad bleeds Tick key -- hate those bugs Butterfly bandages - medium cuts Sudafed -- okay, this is just to handle my sinuses Hydrocortizone -- soothes some stings, bites, etc. Tweezers Lip Balm -- Good for any kind of chapped skin, not just lips. If your face is badly wind chapped, this can be a godsend. Moleskin and 2nd Skin -- Moleskin is OK, but 2nd skin with a moleskin over it is unbeatable for blister treatment. Something for irrigation of deeper wounds (discovered the hard way that this is important) With the exception of the EpiPen and Splint, this all fits in a quart freezer bag and goes in the very top of my pack in a separate compartment. We tell everyone where it is. Everything is also sub-packaged into smaller (cheap) snack size ziplocks. You don't want your gauze wet or contaminated because you needed a tylenol. I also packed things together logically (for me). Bandages, triple antibiotic, and iodine all into one ziploc. Pills in little containers (packed with cotton so they won't break). One tip for labeling your pills. Use a sharpie then clear tape over the writing. Sharpie will wipe off of most plastic containers in time. We've never lost the writing this way.

From Wikipedia : Parachute cord (also paracord or 550 cord) is a lightweight nylon kernmantle rope originally used in the suspension lines of US parachutes during World War II. Once in the field, paratroopers found this cord useful for many other tasks. It is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. I'd argue that it's more than just a survival rope -- it's useful in many regular camp tasks like hanging a bear bag or putting up a clothes line. Unfortunately, the term ""parachute cord"" has been slapped on cheaper knock-offs that aren't up to the military's original specifications, so it's not as strong.

1513,,What is the proper way to tarp tent to avoid condensation?,wipe down the inside with a bandana,"A poor tarp pitch can lead itself to condensation. Did you use a plastic ground sheet? Water running under the tarp when it's raining can cause a lot of humidity inside the tarp. Were you pitched on long grass? Plant life can increase condensation under a tarp. This can also be alleviated by a plastic ground sheet. How close to the ground was your tarp pitched? Was there any breeze going through the tarp?If you don't allow air to freely move then the humidity is simply going to build up under the tarp. Increasing air flow by increasing exposure to outside elements might seem counter intuitive, but it's likely you'll end up considerably drier and warmer inside even if a little rain splashes in from the sides or the wind is constantly blowing on you. Tarp camping is absolutely an advanced technique. There are countless ways to pitch a tarp and it takes knowledge, practice, and experience just like anything else. Expanding my answer some :) Condensation occurs because it is warmer and more humid inside the tarp than it is outside. If you have a breeze or stronger wind, it's easy to reduce condensation by creating an opening on the windward side and having the opposite side wide open, allowing for good airflow. If it gets to the point where the wind is too cold then you are likely passed the point gathering condensation so you can reduce the wind entrance. Next on your agenda is to increase the steepness of the tarp sides in the pitch. Steep sides means gravity is pulling the condensation down the sides instead of pooling on a flatter pitch, waiting to drop down on you. A taut pitch is also necessary here because sag in the tarp gives water a place to collect that isn't on the ground. Camp in higher (and dryer) places. This applies to all camping. Moisture gathers in the valleys and even a spot a few meters higher in elevation can make a difference. Meadows are similarly bad. And in conditions where condensation is simply unavoidable, the only course of action is to occasionally wipe down the inside with a bandana. Even double wall tents get condensation in conditions like constant rain.. they're just not going to notice it as much thanks to the mesh blocking most water drops.",wipe down the inside with a bandana,0.305921108,2010,2045,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1513

But here is my take on the features in a rough order of importance: Warranty: If you plan on heavy usage, make sure it has a lifetime warranty and a manufacturer that backs it up. Many will find a way to replace it in the field. Weight: If you're backpacking, saving weight is important. Comfortable handle: You're going to be holding these all day. Make sure they don't rub anywhere that would result in a blister. Make sure you can keep your grip when sweating, and make sure the wrist strap holds on without getting in the way. Adjustable/compact: If you want it to easily pack in the trunk or in luggage for a flight, this feature is necessary. Some level of adjustment is useful to shift from climbing uphill to braking downhill. Check the quality of the adjustment locks, you don't want them to slip when you're bracing yourself from a dunk in the river, and you want to be able to easily fix any problem in the field (preferably without carrying a set of wrenches). Steel point: You want this to hold if you press against a rock, and not slide all over the place. Snow baskets: If you plan on using these in the winter, these will keep you from plunging all the way to the ground with every step. Otherwise, they're not really important. Shock absorption: I passed on this feature, but I can see it being useful for those with joint problems. A good set of poles should last a lifetime, so don't be afraid to spend a few extra bucks on a better model.

3301,,What is a good tool for minor trail maintenance while hiking?,folding saws,"I do deliberate trail maintenence regularly, and unfortunately what you can do is severly limited if you want to do it casually while only carrying something small. There is no set of tools you can reasonably carry, even if you go out only for that purpose, that will cover more than maybe 3/4 of the problems you find. My preferred weapons for deliberate trail maintenence are work gloves with leather palm and palm-side of the fingers, a bow saw, and a small pair of clippers. The clippers are the kind you can work with one hand. This is a tradeoff, but gives you good coverage for most problems up to where a chainsaw would be needed. The problem with bringing more than one tool is that you constantly have to keep switching the tool you are using, and therefore have to put the other tool where you can find it again and won't forget it. The bow saw is relatively light and easily carried in one hand. I don't want something in the other hand, else I'd always have to put it down when using the bow saw. That's why I bring a small pair of clippers so I can keep them in a back pocket. A bow saw is probably the single best tool. You may be surprised what you can cut with it. White pines ( Pinus strobus , the easiest trees to cut here in New England) up to 6 inches can be handled. Oaks and harder wood up to 4 inches without too much trouble, and 6 inches if you're willing to spend some time and put some effort into it. That means multiple cuts to make a notch, probably from both sides. With a pine, in contrast, you make a small cut on one side, 1/3 of the way thru from the other, and then just push it over. Downed limbs is more work but the same sizes can eventually be handled. Other useful tools are a long pair of loppers, the kind it takes both hands to operate. However, if you've got one of those, you really can't do much else. This only makes sense therefore if you're in a group. Me with bow saw and small clippers, one person with large clippers, and one with a chain saw is a pretty good team. You can get more fancy, in some cases by adding someone with a rake or something that can rearrange dirt in the right conditions, but in the general case I'd rather have a fourth person have just ""bare hands"" (with good work gloves on, or course). A good part of the time you're just breaking things off with your hands, moving logs out of the way, or are dragging something off the trail that was just cut. For me at least, I rather either go out to work on the trail or to hike. Each would significantly impact the other, so it's more trouble than it's worth in my opinion. I also regularly do trail work, so I don't feel bad at all about just going out and hiking and leaving the maintenence to someone else occasionally. If you really want to do some maintenence while hiking without carrying much or taking much time, you're going to have to realize up front you're only going to fix a small part of the problems you encounter. I can see three levels of ""casual"" trail maintenence while the main point of the outing was just hiking. In order of seriousness: Bare hands. Wear a good pair of work gloves and do what you can. This has the advantage that you don't have to carry extra tools, you're always ""ready"", and you do a lot without even stopping. If you've never done trail work, you'll probably be surprised how much you can actually accomplish with ""bare hands"", suitably gloved so you don't think twice about grabbing a rough piece of wood hard and yanking and throwing it. A whole bunch of maintenence is simply clearing relatively small stuff that has broken off trees and fallen onto the trail. Remember that when dragging larger branches, drag them trunk-end first else they get hung up on everything. Think of them sortof as one-way ratchets. Add small clippers to the work gloves. You'll probably keep the clippers in the pocket and do bare hands things most of the time, but sometimes clippers are just what you need to deal with encroaching branches. Two rules to remember: If in doubt, cut it out! Inexperienced trail maintainers tend to cut branches right at the edge of the trail. Think about it. Trees grow, which is why the branch is now over the trail in the first place. Are you going to come every week and trim the branches back? I didn't think so. Think a few years out. If the branches from a 30 foot tree 3 feet from the trail are getting in the way now, think what will happen as soon as you leave after trimming them. If the tree is only 3 feet from the trail, cut the whole branch right at the trunk and you won't have that problem again. If it's a 10 foot tree, lose the whole tree. Problem permanently solved. Don't be timid. The trail is a small path thru big woods. Cutting branches back to 10 feet instead of the 5 foot trail width isn't going to hurt the forest, but it will keep the trail clear another two years longer, at least from that tree. Never put a small hand tool on the ground You may be tempted to put a tool down ""just for a minute"" while you use a different tool or drag off a branch or something. Don't. Put it in your pocket. Sooner or later you're going to forget to pick it up. When you come back to look for it, you'll suddenly realize how small the tool and how big the woods are. Unless you remember exactly where you put it (and you won't), it's gone. I've even ""lost"" my bow saw for a while a few times, and that's much bigger than a small pair of clippers. I can't put the bow saw in my pocket, but I do have to get it out of my hands regularly. I make a special discipline out of deliberately putting it in the middle of the trail a bit further in the direction I will be going . That way, it's easier to find because the trail is presumably more clear, and if I forget I'll more likely notice it when continuing on. The last level of causal trail work while otherwise hiking is one of those folding saws. They are actually pretty crappy saws and nowhere near as effective as a bow saw, but they do work and will be the only way to cut something too big or tough for small clippers. That would be a white pine maybe 3/4 inch in diamter or something harder 1/2 inch. Anything more effective than these three levels requires a more serious commitment to maintenence such that I wouldn't call it hiking anymore.",folding saws,0.612253189,5879,5891,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3301

6499,,What happens if I inadvertently set off a personal locator beacon?,prevent a search from being initiated,"They're not very easy to activate. Here's a video showing how to activate the one I own. It's a multi-step process. You have to flip up a tab (which I think involves cracking a thin plastic connection), use the tab to pull off the cover, unfurl the antenna, and then press the on button, which is hidden until you get the cover off. Anyway, I did find a description here of what happened when a skier accidentially activated his. Apparently he had his PLB in his pocket during a ski run, and somehow knocked the cover off, didn't realize that the cover was off, and then the ""on"" button got pressed. Seems like a very unlikely sequence of events, but I guess out of some large number of users, freak accidents like this are going to happen. What happened next in his case was that the Air Force called his wife, his wife called him on his cell phone, and they were able to straighten things out over the phone. He wasn't fined or thrown in jail. Presumably the Air Force called his home phone because he'd supplied that phone number when he registered the unit.

It's very common for search and rescue teams to get hurt, especially in mountain environments. You want to be very careful not to put these folks in danger unnecessarily. There are probably two reasonable options if you do activate it unnecessarily and don't have phone contact. (1) You could hike out to where you can get phone service and prevent a search from being initiated. (2) You could stay put and make it easy for them to find you.

6661,,"What do the climbing terms ""Redpoint"", ""Pinkpoint"", ""Flash"" and ""Onsight"" mean?",climbing the route in exactly the same way,"The two terms specifically refer to the finer aesthetics of Lead Climbing , in which a climber will either create intermediate anchors using gear (referred to as traditional climbing), or will use the bolted anchors on a wall (referred to as sport climbing), and clip the rope to them as he/she ascends for protection. To understand the two terms, you will need to understand some other terms first: Onsight , and Flash . Flash : If you were to climb a route using either of these two methods, and made it to the top of the route both without falling, and without resting your weight on the belay chain, you have successfully flashed the route, congratulations! Onsight : If you did all the above without getting any Beta , then you have successfully on-sighted the route, you get a double congratulations! ( Beta is defined as any information pertaining to the climb, like where the hardest moves are or the best ways to get through or avoid them ). If you fall or rest on the rope (held by your belayer) during your first attempt to flash or on-sight a route, but know that you could have done better, you may decide to try again after coming down. Pinkpoint : A successful second, third, or twentieth attempt to climb the route from start to finish, without either falling or resting on the rope, will net you the pinkpoint, hi-five! Redpoint : Lastly, the redpoint, which is only slightly different to the pinkpoint, refers to climbing the route in exactly the same way, but while having to place the gear to protected the route as you ascend. If you managed to do this, you have redpointed the route, double hi-five! The difference between redpoint and pinkpoint can seem subtle, so here is a picture from Alli Rainey's site to better explain. The route he is climbing on the left side already has some quick-draws in place to clip to, the route to his right however, does not. A climber going up the right side of the picture would have to take quick-draws with to attach to these hangers. The term redpoint originates from German climber Kurt Albert in the 70's. He painted a red-circle at the base of a climb which he later filled in once successfully free-climbing the entire route.",climbing the route in exactly the same way,0.297183007,1431,1473,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6661
6710,,What are common climbing techniques for strongly overhanging walls and roofs?,heel hooks,"Here are a couple Climb on your Skeleton Overhanging climbing is hard work and tiring. You need to reduce the stress on your muscles by letting your skeleton hold as much of your body weight as possible. Keep your arms straight and your muscles relaxed, don't try and hold yourself against the face. Pull only when you need to pull Use your shoulders/Twist your body When reaching on overhanging terrain in order to make better use of your skeleton (above), if you twist your body (for example) to the left with your (for example) right hand straight, your left hand will be able to reach further without you pulling with your right bicep. This allows you make tough moves with the lowest amount of effort. Keep moving Unless you're Adam Ondra, you're going to get more tired on overhanging terrain. Try and keep moving. If you have to keep stopping to work out moves, etc. you're going to run out of energy. Visualise the moves, etc. before you start. This will save energy when you get to the moves as you won't have to try and figure them out when you get to them, all the time wasting energy. Foot work is even more important on overhanging terrain. Keep your feet up Don't let your feet fall behind your hands. If you're too stretched out you will swing away from the wall and you'll have to pull hard to get back on it. You want your knees bent most of the time. Use your feet to hold weight You can't expect your hands to hold your entire body weight for an extended period of time. You need your feet to hold as much of your weight as possible. To do this you need to tense your core. This requires core strength(stomach/back) which may take some time to build. You also may need to use techniques such as heel hooks.

8831,,What are the best methods for hanging food in a tree?,The PCT hang,"In most places without extremely human habituated bears, a simple hang with the line tossed over a sturdy, isolated branch and tied off to an adjacent tree trunk is suitable. The bag should end up being roughly 12 feet above the ground, 5 feet away from the trunk and 5 feet below the branch. The PCT hang is a clever variation of this which eliminates the possibility of a bear swiping the line with its claws where it's tied off to the trunk. You begin the same way, but ensure you have a carabiner at the end of the line, then clip the line back through it again before pulling it up as high as you can go. You then take a sturdy several inch long stick, put a clove hitch into the line as high as you can reach, and slide that stick into the clove hitch before gently lowering the line back down. The stick will bump into the carabiner, preventing the bag from lowering any further and preventing any cutting of the line below from releasing the food bag. To get your food back down, pull down on the line until the stick comes back into reach, remove it from the clove hitch, and then lower as normal.",The PCT hang,0.020368857,293,305,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8831

In case of page deletions here is a brief summary of the information: Shelters made out of cuben fabric never need re-coating. All other fabrics do have a coating which will degrade over their lifespan, mainly due to rubbing, the degrading effect of UV light from the sun and storing it wet. Shelter fabrics usually have either one of those two coatings: a silicone coating or a PU-coating (polyurethane). Tent floors usually have a PU-coating while tent flysheets usually have a silicone coating. However, a PU-coating is still used by some manufacturers on their tent flysheets. It is important to know which kind of coating has been applied to your shelter as each of these two kind of coatings need another product and solvent for re-coating. Some tents like for example those of MSR even have a different coating on each side of the fabric of the tent fly, a silicone coating on the outside and a PU-coating along the inside. If you‚Äôre not sure about the type of coating, try to contact the manufacturer.Coatings based on silicone are the easiest to renew. In case of a PU-coating it is more difficult to find the right product and solvent. Ok, what do you need? These are the necessary items for a silicone coating: White spirit A tube of silicone: transparent and odorless (without additives) A silicone syringe A clean pot or jar An accurate weighing scale (one gram accuracy recommended) A paint brush A pair of protective gloves (you‚Äôll notice I didn‚Äôt wear gloves but you should know better) For a PU-coating you‚Äôll need an urethane based product and an appropriate solvent. One can also try the expensive option like Tent Sure Tent floor sealant from Mcnett or the Nikwax variant. Otherwise the method for a PU-coating will be rather similar as I‚Äôm going to explain for a silicone coating. 1.Pitch the tent in a well ventilated area, preferable outdoors(on a sunny day). If weather conditions cause a good bit of dust and debris to carry in the air wait, or move indoors. While minimal dust will not affect the quality of your application large particles (like the neighbor mowing) will affect adhesion. 2.Clean to prepare fabric for coating. Make sure that fabric is completely dry before attempting to recoat. 3.Prepare mixture: Pour white spirits(15) and silicone(1) into a jar (weighing) the components so that there is a 15:1 ratio. As a general guideline try to using a 1.5g/1 sq. m estimate when purchasing materials. Consider each side of your tent/tarp an independent area if you are going to coat both sides. Stir until spirits and silicone are dissolved. 4.Paint mixture onto fabric ensuring that no runs or drops gather on the fabric. Once dried touch the surface to determine if coating is thick enough. IF necessary apply another coat. Some minor discoloration may be noticed due to operator errors. (Who can perfectly and evenly paint that kind of surface?) 5.After you are confident the tent is 100% dry test the coating with a spritz of water. If the water beads and runs off you have succeeded.

9157,,What types of trees are in these intertwined groups in Massachusetts?,roots,"You may like the look, but those trees are in the process of being killed by a nasty invasive, Oriental Bittersweet ( Celastrus orbiculatus ). It is one of the more common invasives in MA. There have been many things writting about this invasive. It's been on any list of invasive plants in MA that I've seen. Do a search and you'll see. DCR (MA Department of Conservation and Recreation) has several publications on invasives, which will include information about Oriental Bittersweet. Bittersweet likes a lot of sun, so often starts growing where there is a new opening in the canopy due to a large tree falling over, logging, or other human clearing activities. There are enough instances of this plant around, that chances are good a bird will drop a seed nearby. If this is at the edge of the woods where there is a lot of sun, the small plants grow, climb up exising trees, and eventually strangle them to death. It is unfortunately all too common at forest edges, like along the sides of highways. Next time you drive down I-495, 490, and the like, notice the green ""blanket"" covering the open side of the forest edge. Once you know what to look for, you'll see this plant everywhere. For small areas, like your yard, mechanical control can be effective. The wood is soft and easy to cut with hand clippers up to maybe 1"" in diameter. Cutting at the ground kills the vine in the tree, but it doesn't kill the roots. These things spread not only by seed, but also by a network of roots. Find one of the plants a few feet high and pull it up. You'll see that the roots extend sideways often several times the height of the plant. Keep pulling and ripping it up. Keep cutting and pulling, and eventually the plants in that area will die. However, if there are other infestations nearby, and there probably are, birds will deposit new seeds. You have to be vigilant anyplace there is good sun. It's a lot less work to pull a few new plants once a month than to deal with a widespread web of roots a couple of years later. Your pictures show a mature infestation that has been there for a number of years. You can get a bunch of volunteers together and cut and pull what you can, but without coming back regularly and pulling any new sprouts, you'll just have the same problem again in another few years. You have a well established root network that will need to be deprived of food from leaves for quite a while to eventually go away.",roots,0.204328746,1486,1491,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9157

And, it probably takes a bit more time to pitch and take down simply because of the added material to manipulate. Because your bio says you want to go ultralight, these cons may be very important to you. A possible con is that snow may weigh down the FCRF more and faster than the partial because it has more area, but banging from the inside to clear off snow usually works OK (my experience is only April through Nov.) Another con to the FCRF is that you are more disconnected from the outside. Being connected vs not getting wet is a personal decision. (Curious: If you want to go ultralight, why aren't you asking about bivvy sacks vs tents?) Pros: The FCRF will not only keep you drier, but warmer, especially if it is windy. A pro to the FCRF that I like is that, except in heavy, driving rain you don't have to bring your boots inside to keep them dry -- the overlap of the fly protects them very well.

9543,,What type of bird seed attracts the most amount of birds?,Small seeds,"This answer may apply to other countries but is pretty cert for the UK. Bird feed sold in the UK (from big chain pet stores, to garden centres, to little corner shops) usually comes with a time of year printed on the packet. This can be Spring-Summer, Winter or All Year for example. Which is because we get a cycle of birds throught the year and what is good for one species isn't good / appetising for all. A brilliant bird food list can be found on the RSPCB websites What Food to Provide page. Good autumn / winter feeds are: Fat balls or bars Black sunflower seeds Mealworms Cooked rice (when food is incredibly scarce) Any feed with large chunks of nut in, these are suitable for winter only. Mealworms and black sunflower seeds are good all year round feeds, used to supplement a birds diet. The type of seed does make a big difference to what is attracted to your garden. Small seeds, such as millet, attract mostly house sparrows, dunnocks, finches, reed buntings and collared doves, while flaked maize is taken readily by blackbirds. Tits and greenfinches favour peanuts and sunflower seeds. Mixes that contain chunks or whole nuts are suitable for winter feeding only. Pinhead oatmeal is excellent for many birds. Wheat and barley grains are often included in seed mixtures, but they are really only suitable for pigeons, doves and pheasants, which feed on the ground and rapidly increase in numbers, frequently deterring the smaller species.

The system of ratings for Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) was developed jointly by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and Underwriters Laboratory (UL) and has been in use for many decades. USCG had announced they were going to revise this system a couple years ago based on feedback from the public that they found the old system not understandable or useful. There has been no update about when a new system will be released. A Type I PFD is also called an off-shore life jacket. It must provide at least 22 pounds (~100N) of buoyancy, must be able to keep an unconscious wearer face-up while in the water, must be reversible, and must be International Orange in color. They are intended for use where rescue is likely to be delayed. You will generally find them only on Naval and cruise ships, and are difficult to find in recreational boating stores. When you do find them, they are a bit more expensive. A Type II PFD is also call a near-shore buoyant vest. It must provide at least 15.5 pounds (~70N) of buoyancy, and must be able to keep a conscious wearer in a vertical or face-up position in the water. These are intended when rescue is likely to be quick. They typically have a ""horse collar"" like appearance. They may be any color but are most often made in orange. These are very common and inexpensive, however most wearers find them uncomfortable for long-term use. A Type III PFD is called a flotation aid. Like a Type II, it must also provide 15.5 pounds (~70N) of buoyancy; however, there is no restriction on how this must be positioned (in other words, it might not help the wearer remain face-up.) It is intended for use when rescue is likely to be almost immediate. These come in many designs and colors- often specially made for the activity such as paddling, fishing, water skiing, etc. They are the most comfortable to wear. A Type IV PFD is a throwable device. Ring buoys, seat cushions, and the collar buoys usually carried by sailboats are all Type IV. A Type V PFD is a special-use device. Typically, a Type V qualifies that same as one of the other wearable types but only when worn. The full-body suits worn by the crews of fishing vessels are a good example. Note that the buoyancy and turning requirements for inflatable types are more strict than for traditional (kapok or foam) types. In the US, your vessel must carry one wearable (Type I, II, III, or V) for each person on board, that is properly fitted for that person. You must also carry one Type IV for the entire vessel.

I did think that I could have helped a bit by giving them a couple worms when I poked my head in to take a look. Every time they'd hear something near by the nest, they'd pop they're heads up with their mouths open, which appeared to take a lot of exertion when they were small. I tried finding caterpillars and soft bugs for them to eat a couple of times, but while I was looking, Mom would always show up with a mouth full of grubs and sit on the fence waiting for me to leave so she could fly in and feed her chicks, so I just let them be after that.

Avoid it , even if you are not new to climbing. Be prepared for it on long routes, even when you are not expecting to be climbing at night. Most of my night-climbing came about unplanned. Make sure you can do everything involved in climbing with your eyes closed . In the shower. (Setting up for rappel, tying in and untying, building rappel anchors... just to name a few things...) Pay extra attention to communication with your partner. If clouds begin to cover the moon, conserve batteries and turn off your headlamp when belaying. Make sure your skill level is such that the idea of turning your lights off at a belay or loosing your light altogether doesn't frighten you. Even if all is going fine, keep your eyes out for places you might be able to spend the night if things go south later on. Don't dismiss small ledges, I have spent a night sitting upright. That was way better than sleeping at a hanging belay. Know how long your headlamp lasts and bring extra batteries . Make sure someone knows what you are up to and let people know when to expect you back . This one is not just for your safety. If someone tries to find you at night and you are not in your tent, they might assume something has happened and contact YOSAR. Figure out how to attach your headlamp to your helmet. Before you start climbing. Plan in extra time . It will take longer. Be extra diligent about researching weather conditions , since you won't be able to see weather approaching as well. Move efficiently but safely. Your belayer will thank you, since it can get cold. Don't rely on technology to find your way . (Applicable to life in general) Climb with someone you have climbed with before. This goes back to the communication issue. Get some sleep before you jump into your car and drive home. Have the ""cuddle talk"" with your partner. Don't engage in any night-climbing with a haphephobiac who would rather die of hypothermia than share some body-heat. Here is some advice for climbing Half Dome at night: Harness up for the decent on the cables. That section of the dome can have whet spots, and since you are at significantly higher elevation than the valley floor, you might encounter conditions where parts of the decent are frozen over. Temperatures can be more than 20 degrees F lower up there, which can mean below freezing, even in summer months. If you are planning on descending the death-slabs, make sure you have taken them at least once during the day (either up or down). Route-finding for those unfamiliar with that decent can become a nightmare at night. Get an overnight-wilderness permit for Little Yosemite from the ranger station near the post office in the Valley. That way, if you don't make it back and have to sleep somewhere on you way back down you won't get ticketed. Since you are already at the ranger station, ask for the conditions up there at night. There is a section where the dike splits off in two directions. Make sure you stay on route. Don't sleep on top. It is illegal even with an overnight permit for Little Yosemite. Don't walk off the edge above the northwest face.",weather conditions,0.439270675,1475,1493,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13106
13212,,What to be aware of if lightning strikes close to me?,risks,"It seems you are asking about risks of lightning striking close by, but not directly on you. In other words, the lightning current isn't passing thru you on its way between the ground and the sky. There are certainly risks. I think the two main ones are flying debris and ground currents. The current in lightning is very high, can heat things above the boiling point of water during the short time of the lightning strike. The steam pressure causes things to explode or to be ejected. The bark of trees can be exploded outward, for example. I know someone who saw lightning strike a stone wall by the side of a road, and some of the rocks get ejected onto the road. You can certainly get hurt from flying debris within a few meters, probably up to 10 meters or so. Ground currents can cause electrocution, but not by getting directly hit by the lightning. Again, the current in lighting is very high. This current fans out when it enters the ground. It doesn't just go to zero immediately. There will still be substantial currents some distance from where the lightning hit the ground. Also the ground is not uniform, so the current does not spread out uniformly and can be channeled by geographic features. All this means the ground currents can still be substantial up to a few 10s of meters away from where the lighting hit the ground. The reason ground currents matter is because they cause a voltage drop across the ground. This voltage drop is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the ground. You don't really care about the current going thru the ground beneath you, but you do care about the voltage difference this current causes along the ground. For example, if the current causes 1000 volts/meter underneath you, and you are standing with your two feet ¬Ω meter apart oriented in line with that current, then your feet get exposed to 500 volts. This therefore indicate three things you can do to minimize shock from ground currents due to lighting that might strike nearby: Present the smallest ""footprint"" across the ground as possible. This minimizes the voltage across the ground that you are exposed to for the same ground current. Insulate yourself from the ground as much as possible. If you have a foam pad with you, for example, sit on it on the ground instead of directly on the ground. It won't be a perfect insulator, but this is all a probability game anyway. More insulation gives you a higher chance of not getting hurt. Find a spot ground currents are less likely to travel over. This can be tricky, so in some cases you skip this. For example, sitting on a rock outcrop that itself has a small footprint can be helpful. Of course if that puts you higher up on a flat plane, then that's a bad idea since it increases the chance of a direct hit. A direct hit is always worse than shock due to ground currents. If you're not sure about this, skip it.",risks,0.25955686,30,35,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13212
13457,,What to look for in (trail-)running shoes for various terrain?,sole is too thin,"People can say anything they want about running shoes, and manufacturers too. It's 99% nonsense, not based on any evidence ( example ). There are basically only two conclusions I know of that are supported by evidence: (1) If you're interested in reducing your chances of getting an injury such as a repetitive stress injury, the evidence shows that your likelihood of injury is very insensitive to what kind of shoe you use. The evidence only really shows that changing what you do (changing your shoes, changing your running style, ...) temporarily leads to a higher probability of injury. The interpretation is that your brain-body system adapts in very sophisticated ways. It can adapt to almost anything, but it can't do it suddenly. (2) Having less weight on your foot increases performance. I recognized that some surfaces (especially the gravel) trouble the mentioned shoes pretty much. I feel like the sole is too thin. So, what do I have to look for in ""all terrain"" running shoes? The evidence ( [1] , [2] ) does not support the idea that a thicker, more cushioned sole reduces injury. It appears that your body adapts to whatever amount of cushioning you have. The way you pose the question is interesting, because it implies that you believe trail running to be more stressful than running on streets, so that more cushioning would be needed. Among many runners, the conventional wisdom is the opposite: they believe that hard pavement is harder on the body, and that they're less likely to be injured if they run on nice soft dirt and turf. Anyway, neither view is supported by the evidence. As a runner, I always try to focus on the happy part of this message. The happy message is that no evidence forces you to do anything in particular in order to avoid injury. Therefore you can do whatever feels good and enjoyable, and not worry that you're going to get hurt because you're doing it wrong. What to look for in (trail-)running shoes for various terrain? Because there is zero evidence for essentially any of the manufacturers' claims, it's not a good idea to pay more than you have to. Buy cheap running shoes. If you're trying to run fast and competitively, buy lighter shoes.

13756,,What is the energy difference between green and seasoned fire wood?,4.5kWh/kg = 16.2MJ/kg,"TLDR You need about 15 to 20% more green wood to achieve the same amount of heating as with seasoned wood. Calculation According to the linked Wikipedia article green wood weighs 70-100% more than seasoned wood and seasoned wood has an energy content of 4.5kWh/kg = 16.2MJ/kg. This obviously depends on the wood, but we are just looking for an estimate. Therefore any equal sign used here is meant as approximately equal. As wood is usually measured and sold in volume (cord, stere, cubic meters, ...) we neglect the additional weight of the water and just take into account the energy lost due to ""boiling"" it. Water has a specific heat of 4181J/(kg K) and vaporization heat of 2257kJ/kg. Assuming an initial wood temperature of 0degC green wood thus has an energy content of (16.2 - (2.257 + 0.004181 * 100) * 0.7 to 1)MJ/kg = 14.3 to 14.9MJ/kg.",4.5kWh/kg = 16.2MJ/kg,0.390749067,254,275,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13756

14189,,What type of rope to use for the mainsheet of sunfish?,double-braided poly,"You most definitely want to be selective when selecting rope for a sailboat's running rigging. I'll group sailboats into two categories: racing and non-racing. Racing sailboat is simply any boat where it participates in a race, not any particular construction. For racing sailboats, you will want to stick as close to the manufacturer's specified lines, and your class rules likely also require it. The details of that are beyond the scope of this answer. For all other sailboats, what is most important is the rope material. For size, within a millimeter or so is usually fine, though you'll want to err on too small rather than too large so that the rope doesn't bind in through any blocks or winches. For dinghies and small boats, control lines are usually sized large to be easy to grip and hold on to, and as a result don't come anywhere close to their yield strength, so don't worry if you're a tiny bit smaller than the stock line. For material, your hardware store options were nylon and polypropylene. Nylon is a no-go for running rigging. It is stretchy and loses strength when wet. Polypropylene is acceptable but isn't the best. It's not very durable and will have to get replaced more often and you'll have to inspect it more regularly. The materials that remain are basically polyester and a bunch of newish high-tech fibers. Unless you're in a world-class race, there really is no point in getting the other fibers unless you want to throw more money into the water than you would be normally. Polyester is what you'll want. Virtually all sailboats not owned by millionaires are equipped with polyester running rigging. For a sunfish, pretty much any double-braided polyester line in the right size will do the job just fine. This page goes into additional detail.

14384,,What are the feathers under the hackle in the rooster saddle?,wings,"Yes, those do look like a soft hackle of some kind. I don't know which bird, but as long as they are soft they can be useful for a number of purposes. Globalflyfisher.com has some excellent info on specific fly tying, and their page on soft hackle includes this: Using soft hackle Soft hackle feathers are excellent for several purposes: Soft, wrapped hackle where the barbs will move gently in the water without the stiffness typical for rooster hackle. The hackle can be very sparse as on spiders and flymphs or denser as is the case on certain nymphs and many wet flies and even very dense as it's often used on salmon and steelhead flies or saltwater flies. False hackles where a bunch of barbs sit under the front of the fly. This can be obtained either by hackling as usual and stroking down the barbs or by simply tying in a bunch of cut-off barbs under the hook shank and letting them fan out slightly. Wet fly wings - both whole feathers and made from married or bundled barbs. A lot of really classic wet fly patterns use whole feathers mounted vertically while others use the more common style of marrying barbs to form a typical wet fly feather wing. A special use of soft hackle in wings is the matuka style, where whole feathers are tied in as wings along the top of the hook shank. Dry fly wings. On dry flies the barbs are sometimes rolled to form a vertical wing and at other times the tips of the feathers are tied in as fan wings, back to back, creating amazingly natural looking wings for flies such as mayflies. Used in tails where the feather can be tied in as very controlled, married strips or as a simple, rolled bunch of barbs.

14710,,What features should I look for in a satellite emergency device?,"1 button ""I'm in trouble"" as well as text messages","PLB: Robust. Simple to operate. Most have a battery that enables standby for years. No account needed. Newer ones provide GPS location. Downsides: Inflexible. You can only say, ""I'm in trouble, come get me"" Requires special radios to track. It has zero subtlety: The people receiving the call have no idea of the number of people involved, or the urgency. Nor do they get any indication of special circumstances. Minimum 1 hour time between pushing the button and the appropriate SAR being notified. (See link below.) No way to tell if there is anyone responding. SAR services are an unknown quantity. Many are excellent. Some are moribund, or part of the local emergency scene and stretched thin. https://www.mrtsos.com/plbs-explained/what-is-a-personal-locator-beacon-plb Satellite Messenger: Allows text messages bidirectionally between locations. Sends GPS coordinates. Can be configured to send breadcrumbs (locations) at user setable intervals. Shorter response time -- typically a few minutes. By using it, you get familiar with limitations. Downsides: Uses power. Can easily run your battery flat on an expedition. Possibly less robust. Requires account and activation. You need to set up a responsible someone to receive messages either by email or text. This may increase the delay in getting action. ( https://explore.garmin.com/en-CA/inreach/ ) Sat Phone Voice communication. Easy to resolve issues quickly. By using it, you get familiar with limitations. Can phone anyone in the world. Downsides: Larger, heavier, more expensive Eats batteries. (Carry one spare that is reserved for emergency) Requires clear view of sky. Does not automatically send GPS location. Requires current account. The following is option based. You need to decide the relative merits. I've spend years (literally -- add up all my trips and it's just under 3 years) in the bush. The need to communicate with the outside rises quite frequently in situations that are short of life or death. A PLB a good answer for scenarios where someone has an injury that immobilizes him. But consider the following scenarios. I would not want to activate SAR for any of these situations. We've wrapped one of our two canoes around a rock. (Happened to a friend. They had to abandon the good canoe and walk out.) I don't need rescue. I need another canoe ) Mike has lost his insulin bottle. Can someone airdrop me a bottle of insulin ) Bear came into camp, ate the next two weeks groceries. (Happened to me, but he only got today's lunch) Move up our Cree Lake food drop, and add 15 lbs each of rice and beans ) Fred has what looks like appendicitis. I need to talk to someone to tell for sure. There is a forest fire in front of you, and you need to change routes, so you need some different maps. (Happened to me canoeing in N. Sask. Being paranoid, I happened to have maps for the route change.) Look instead at something like In-Reach This gives you both emergency 1 button ""I'm in trouble"" as well as text messages. You have the flexibility to say that you need help, that you need a new canoe, that you need insulin, groceries. The costs are fairly modest, and you can sleep your account for months you're not in the field. Transmission time ranges from instant to minutes, with typical times being about 3 minutes for round trip. The next step up is a satellite phone. Last time I did a remote trip with clients this ran about $200/month plus $3/minute for usage. Connectivity wasn't perfect: You need a clear view of the sky, and even so there are pauses in coverage. This was using the Iridium system. We carried a spare battery for it. For individual users, the InReach is affordable. For expeditions a sat phone gives you a better response and gets things resolved in far less time. In addition you can pay for it by charging clients $150 for ten minutes from the middle of nowhere. I have carried PLBs on trips. We never used it. Didn't want to bring the whole world down around our ears. I've carried SSB radios too. These are a PITA, as it takes a good hour to set up the antenna (long wave, down near AM frequencies) Unreliable at best. Our protocol said, ""Send out a plane if you haven't gotten a transmission in 72 hours"" I've used two text based services. The first filled a 20"" pelican case, weighed 30 pounds, and typically took 20 minutes to send a text message. The second was an In-Reach. I used this when I took my nephew and my dog for a week in Willmore Wilderness. We made a point of sending a text every evening, and waiting for a reply. We had no problems with it, and used sparingly we still had 40% of battery at the end of the week. (We carried a USB battery to recharge it just in case.) I've used Sat phones on a few trips. Reliability is about the same as for GPS. If you can see enough sky for your GPS, then generally your sat phone will work. We have had issues with bad antennas, faulty battery packs, and getting the device wet.

14860,,What are the risks when encounter a wild animal when camping?,"stolen food, and destruction of property","Yes, there is always a risk. You mitigate those risks by your behavior, and, since you didn't mention what behavioral steps you took/take, then it's difficult to answer your questions. You also didn't mention where you camp, although you did mention you were in France. But you can camp all over the world, and each place carries unique dangers that other places need not worry about. When you have already encountered the animal, it also depends on who found whom first: if you found the animal first, you run the risk of startling it, which, depending on the animal, its state, and its environment, may run away or attack. Snakes Most snakes will see you as a threat and will attempt retreat. If not possible, or they are startled, you may get bitten. Of course, what happens after this depends much on the snake being venomous or not. Small dinosaurs Any Floridian and Australian will tell you to watch out for alligators and crocodiles. Encounters with these animals almost never end well, no matter who encounters whom. If you think casual campers need not worry, just remember that an alligator recently killed a young child in Disney World's Grand Floridian hotel. And golfers there commonly see these on the courses. Lazy lizards Most lizards and reptiles are harmless, insofar as being bitten (snapping turtles are a dangerous exception). But many are carriers of disease, like salmonella. And many are protected. Bears Black bears typically range from friendly to shy, and baby cubs will often scout out human contact, creating a logistics nightmare for mom. However, it's not uncommon for bear families to be friendly and playful, if annoying, to their human ""hosts"". If the bears are hungry or agitated from a previous encounter, they may become aggressive. If the bears are not used to human contact, they can become extremely dangerous. Grizzly bears are always dangerous, your danger here is you will likely be attacked by these kinds. Skunks If you startle or anger a skunk, you will not be allowed to ride home with your camping companions for the next decade. Other small animals (groundhog, possum, racoons, rabbits, etc) Not to worry. Except your food stores. Risks here are stolen food, and destruction of property in their attempts to get at said food. Raccoons in particular are very adept at stealing. One small animal you must not touch is armadillos: they are common and friendly, but they can carry leprosy. Big game (deer, moose, elk, etc) Watch out. During mating season, they're extremely territorial, and moose in particular, will not think twice about charging at you. In addition, it's not uncommon for them to fight over females; in this case, one may chase the other, or they engage each other where your campsite happens to be. Your risks here can be anywhere from having your things stomped upon, them getting entangled in tarps, hammocks, tents, and tent lines, and you getting stomped on. When not in mating season, you have less to worry about, except for moose and elk. They're still dangerous and you can be charged at. Swine Wild swine are not normally a threat, unless you happen upon a lair with piglets. Then, the mother will become territorial and may attack. In this case, they can be very dangerous - and fast. Fox They are rarely a threat, your biggest worry is your food. They can be friendly in environments where humans frequent. Coyotes, wolves They are territorial, and can occasionally attack. As a rule, they tend to leave humans alone, some are even friendly. Your biggest concern is your food stores. Bats Bats are awesome to have: the more bats, the less bugs. They're harmless, noting the general problems with mammals I mention about, below. Birds Depending on where you're at, falcon, eagles, hawks, owls, and other predator birds can be annoying, as they'll steal food. They generally avoid humans, so, if you have an unwatched steak that's sitting out in the open, it's fair game. However, these predator birds can nevertheless be dangerous to humans. Other birds can be dangerous to touch (eg, Blue-Capped Ifrita and Little Shrikethrush), which, because of its diet on a kind of beetle, can induce numbness not unlike poison dart frogs (another creature you ought to avoid, but, not typically found by most campers). If you happen to be casually camping in Papua New Guinea, watch out for the Pitohui bird, it can also be lethal to the touch. Do stay away from vultures. They won't directly harm you, they're carrion-eaters and are otherwise gentle birds. They are carriers of Really Bad Diseases, anthrax being one of them. Anthrax is a bacteria spread via spores, which come from dead animals (and for this reason, you ought not touch dead animals, either - keep on eye on the boys!) Also depending on where you camp, very large birds like ostrich, rhea, and cassowary are very dangerous animals and will typically attack for no (obvious) reason. Mice, Rats Your biggest worry here are the fleas and ticks, which can introduce diseases like Lyme. Insects Well, these can be a problem, too, even though they're not animals. Scorpions, spiders, mosquitos, bees, and centipedes can be dangerous. Know the area you are in. Besides the venomous and stinging variety (either result can trigger anaphylaxis if you have allergies), you also have issues with malaria, lyme, zika, west nile, and others. Speaking of disease, many animals - mammals - can be carriers of rabies and hentavirus. While your biggest concern with large game is being charged at, your biggest worry with smaller animals is disease and symbiotic pests - ticks and fleas. Your encounter with an animal may draw the ire of something other than the animals themselves: the law. Some animals are protected, and so, if you do not take steps to avoid the animal, you may need to later take steps to avoid prosecution. Many reptiles and birds are protected. In addition to finding animals (and the law) a concern, your other concern is hunters. It is common for hunting season and camping seasons to overlap. Good hunting and camping habits dictate that you should wear colored clothing. Otherwise, your otherwise friendly encounter with a deer may end in disaster for you - and not from the deer. One last thing. All animals who have diseases (eg, rabies) or who are sick or injured, or who are pregnant, can exhibit unpredictable behavior. In this case, they are extremely dangerous. So, lots to be careful about. Know your environment, know the law, and be prepared. Remember you are guest in animals' home. Act like a guest. Respect what you see, and take nothing for granted. Are you likely to be attacked by a grunting thing outside your tent? Probably not. Gotta get up in the middle of the night to pee?

15196,,What safety equipment should I carry for sea-touring by kayak?,tow line,"Here's what I normally take with me on these trips at the moment. I can divide them into what's needed before, during and after an incident. Avoiding trouble clothing and food (including drink): as with any outdoor activity, it's important to avoid fatigue and hypothermia. Poor decision-making is the start of most problems, and reduces your ability to correct them. One of the most useful items is a thin thermal balaclava, which I use to regulate heat loss from my head. It takes very little space in a pocket, and really reduces the effect of cold winds. map / chart and tide tables (or tide times for the planned journey): make sure you know where you're going, and what places to avoid. Be aware of tidal streams that could increase the effective distance you'll paddle. I keep the most useful map on deck in a clear case, so I can read it as I go. GPS receiver : although not essential, it's a handy backup to the map, and I get a psychological boost from having a distance countdown to my next destination. I'm using a small handheld that I also use for hillwalking, with maps from OpenStreetMap; these include most of the Aids to Navigation in my area, and I contribute back any corrections I discover. I always carry spare batteries - usually 1-2 days' worth more than I expect to need. VHF radio : The local coastguard station transmits regular safety announcements, with weather forecast every 3 hours, military operations notices a couple of times a day, and other safety information as required. It's really useful to be able to alter plans in advance of a change in the weather. Also, for longer crossings, I contact the coastguard at start and end of the crossing - it's useful to phone them from land before the trip to give vessel details, so you only need to give your callsign on the radio. Getting out of trouble buoyancy aid : Pretty obvious; everyone has one. A simple one is fine, though paying extra will get you features such as pockets (my pockets hold the VHF, beacon and balaclava; there's also a pouch holding a drinks bladder, but you can keep one on deck). paddle float : Re-entry is much, much easier with extra buoyancy on the blade. split paddle : I've never lost my paddle (I made an elastic leash to keep it with the boat), but you can't do much without one, so I always carry a spare on the rear deck. pump : Another obvious one; this is the fastest way to empty the cockpit of water once you're in it again. first aid kit : Usually, this is a small kit for cuts and scrapes; perhaps also a support bandage for strains and sprains. If travelling in company, you can make use of treatments for more serious injuries. I think that what to include in a first aid kit is a good question in its own right. Getting help VHF radio : mentioned above in ""avoiding trouble"", having a DSC set with in-built GPS enables it to transmit your location in a mayday call, reducing the chances of miscommunicated information. Make sure you know how to use it properly - the Short-Range Communication course and exam will likely cost you less than the set itself; it allows you to operate legally, and it's fun! Carry a spare battery, too. beacon : An emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) uses satellite communication to send an alert to the international rescue coordinators when you trigger it. It is important to register your beacon with your country's authorities, so your alert will be recognised as genuine. It's probably best to carry it on your person, rather than in the boat, in case you get separated somehow. If you're counting, this is the third GPS unit I have on board (and that's not counting the one in my camera). flares : A small tub of flares sits behind my seat or in the day-hatch, to guide rescuers to an exact position. Currently, I have two handheld orange smoke and two red pinpoint. They only operate for a short time, so you'd want to save them until you can see (or at least hear) your rescue approaching - even better if you're in radio contact and can be told when to use them. These have a limited shelf life, and need to be replaced after a few years (and the unused ones disposed of responsibly). strobe light and reflective markings : Although I don't intentionally paddle after dark, in an emergency situation these can help improve your visibility to others, supplementing the flares. My kayak top and buoyancy aid both include reflective patches; if yours don't, it may be worth sticking or stitching some one for yourself. I choose Lithium cells for the batteries in the strobe - these have a very long shelf life, so are more likely to work even if you haven't thought about changing them for 5 or 10 years. There are a few things I could have listed above but have chosen not to carry for various reasons: tow line : I have one, but normally only take it if I have company. It might be useful to carry on solo trips too, but the likelihood of being rescued by other kayakers is very low, and I'm running out of space. radar reflector : It would be good to be more visible to other traffic, but my area is quiet enough that collision is very unlikely. On a kayak, there's a trade-off between reflector height and windage. Further reading can be found in Radar, Reflectors and Sea Kayaks: A Visibility Study by Springuel, Travis and MacDonald. helmet : Most time is spent in deep water; although I enjoy travelling along coastlines, I try to keep clear of the rocks. Could be useful in a forced landing, I guess. mobile telephone : Less use than a VHF, as it only allows one-to-one communication, and only with someone whose contact details you know. Also, would need a subscription to network service, which seems expensive, and the coverage is reportedly very patchy. Possibly useful if you have one already and want to check in with someone on shore regularly - but you could cause unnecessary worry if unable to connect when you're expected to. dry suit : Too uncomfortable (hot) for energetic paddling!",tow line,0.417713284,4781,4789,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15196

The vast majority of trails are always going to be more rugged and not aimed at people with handicaps that prevent them from traveling over rough ground. This is not due to some elitist deliberate exclusion, but due to the realities of cost. Handicapped-accessible trails simply cost much much more to build and maintain than typical ""wilderness"" trails. However, the trails community is well aware of handicapped needs and tries to address them when practical. This has been a major topic at the last few Massachusetts State Trails Conferences (yes, there are such things). I'm on the Town of Groton Massachusetts Trails Committee, and can recommend two particular trails in town: Nashua River Rail Trail . This is a paved trail built on a old railroad bed. It goes from Ayer center into Nashua NH, with about 8 miles of it passing thru Groton. A good place to access it is from the parking area off of Broadmeadow Road (42.6049N, 71.5720W). Going south from there to the Groton School Pond and back is a nice outing with a lot of nature around, but flat and easy. John Tinker Trail on Nod Road (42.6286N, 71.5841W) into the J Harry Rich State Forest. This was just built last year. It has a packed stone dust surface suitable for wheel chairs and strollers. It is only about ¬º mile long, but is completely in the woods, with a beautiful view over a old oxbow of the Nashua River at its end: The trail is deliberately winding in places, giving you as much of a ""in the woods"" experience a trail of that width can provide. There are granite benches at intervals, and a wide area with more benches at the end to make a picnic spot. As I mentioned earlier, handicapped-accessible trails are expensive. When we cut a new trail, a few volunteers can do ¬º mile in a couple of hours. There is no direct expense, other than the small ""Groton Trails Network"" markers we put up at intervals as blazes. Even with a directional sign at a junction, the total monetary cost would be under $50. In contrast, the John Tinker trail cost around $30k and took much more work beyond actually building the trail. 80% of the cost was paid for by a state trails grant, with the town funding the remaining 20% directly or thru in-kind donations of volunteer labor. Some private donations were received, and over 80 hours of volunteer labor went into preparing the trailbed for the contractor, so in the end little town tax money had to be used. Just preparing the trail surface for the contractor to do the heavy lifting took a army of volunteers over 80 man-hours. Then there were many hours by a single dedicated volunteer (the chair of our Trails Committee) who wrangled all the permissions, found the contractor, dealt with restrictions due to this being a possible archeological site, wrote the grant application, organized the aforementioned army of volunteers, etc. This single ¬º mile of trail was a major project for the committee for most of a year. You simply can't have a 110-mile trail system and dedicate this level of resource to each ¬º mile.",John Tinker trail,0.182682082,2169,2186,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15327
15424,,What is the minimum knowledge to navigate with only a compass?,you cannot determine your global coordinates,"As you can see from an answer to your other question , you cannot determine your global coordinates via a magnetic compass. Navigation , however, where you wish to use a compass to help you travel from one known global location to another, has been achieved as follows: Using a Gnomonic map , plot a straight line connecting your ""from"" and ""to"" points. The Gnomic projection has the unique property that all great circle routes (i.e., shortest courses on a globe) project as straight lines, no matter what direction they have. Carefully transfer the route from the Gnomonic map onto a Mercator map . Generally stated, your shortest route will plot as a curve. The Mercator projection has the unique property that all loxodromes ‚Äì lines of constant azimuth (or bearing) ‚Äì project as straight lines, no matter their initial directions. It also has the property that angles measured between lines on the map are correct. Segmentize the curved route on the Mercator map. That is, approximate the curve via a sequence of straight lines. Each segment will have constant direction throughout its length. For each segment, set a course for that segment and travel for the distance indicated by that segment. Note that each True course must be ""corrected"" for magnetic declination to get the Magnetic (compass) course. Also note that each measured map distance will need to be corrected for scale distortion and this is a mathematical function of latitude. While your overall line of travel will not be exactly the shortest route, it will always be following a set course. The following example is from GeoGarage.com : First, the shortest route from Seattle to London on a Gnomonic map. Notice its direction changes throughout. Now that same great circle route plotted as a curve on a Mercator map and, in this case, the curve has been ""approximated"" by only a single straight segment, representing a line of constant bearing.

15773,,What is dead reckoning when navigating with a map and compass?,not an accurate technique,"What is dead reckoning? Dead reckoning is the skill of moving along a specific bearing for a specific distance - eg, to walk 350 meters on a 25 degree bearing - without reference to any major feature in the landscape. When is dead reckoning required? The foundation of land navigation is the attack point , a term borrowed from orienteering. Basically, this is a feature you aim for that you are confident you will recognise when you reach it and which moves you towards your eventual target for the day. Typical examples would be a peak, a pass, a trail junction or a hut. By moving from attack point to attack point you get regular checks that you are on course. Many navigation techniques such as handrails and gathering features are aimed at helping you find your attack point. Other techniques such as pacing and timing are designed to alert you that you have missed your attack point. And another group of techniques is designed to help you get back on route once you realise that you have gone astray. Dead reckoning is needed when your next attack point is not visible, and there is no reliable trail to follow. So you have to navigate on a bearing until the attack point becomes visible. This can be because the land is rough or overgrown, or because of fog or whiteout. How do you navigate on a bearing? With a base-plate compass you sight down the direction of travel line and pick out a minor feature such as a tree or a rock, and walk to it. Repeat till your attack point comes into view. In very difficult country such as a featureless desert or ice-field there may be nothing to aim at. In this case you can send a member of your party ahead an agreed number of paces and use a system of signals to move them left or right till they are in line with the direction of travel. Then you walk up to them and repeat. If you are solo, you can throw stones or snowballs along the line of travel. This is a slow and tedious process, but is sometimes life-saving. How do you estimate distance? In many cases you will have to measure how far you have walked along the bearing to avoid over-shooting your attack point. You measure the distance on the map with the correct scale on your compass base-plate. It's important that you know how many paces you need to cover that distance in various conditions, or alternatively, how much time it should take. In critical situations you might want to use both methods. What are the limitations of dead reckoning? Dead reckoning is not an accurate technique, as mistakes cumulate and it is not self-correcting. So experienced navigators do everything they can to minimise the length of dead reckoning legs (anything over 300-400 meters is pretty error-prone), or use handrails and gathering features to minimise the need for accuracy. In safety-critical situations they would often prefer to walk farther on a route that is easier to navigate rather than risk a long dead-reckoning leg. Practice makes perfect Dead reckoning in challenging conditions is a skill you need to develop consciously. When you find yourself in a blinding fog or blizzard, you want to be confident in your technique. The key skills include: Measuring the distance of your dead reckoning leg . Ideally, you'd have done this ahead of time and noted it on your route-card. But you also need to learn how to do this in the field. Knowing how many paces you need to cover the distance . In good weather, you have to measure how many paces you take to cover 100 meters/yards in various ground conditions and slopes, so you can estimate how many paces you will need to reach your attack point. Know how long you need to cover the distance . Counting paces is tedious, so in less critical situations it's easier to estimate distance by time. Again, in good weather you have to experiment till you know your timings over different conditions. Then you have to put the skills together and practice walking dead reckoning legs as regularly as you can in safe situations - even a local park can offer a good practice area.",not an accurate technique,0.477404773,2478,2503,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15773

A difference between this and a Purcell Prusik is that the prusik can slip when catching a fall, absorbing some energy that would otherwise be passed along to you.

16137,,What part of the world has the largest variety of corals?,Indonesian/Philippines archipelago,"What part of the world has the most varieties of corals in a concentrated area? Of coarse this question can only be qualified by an accurate definition of what the OP means by a concentrated area. In any case I am going to put in my two bits worth. Distribution of the world‚Äôs coral reefs (red). Blue areas indicate areas in which zooxanthellate corals occur. The Indonesian/Philippines archipelago has the world‚Äôs greatest concentration of reefs and the greatest coral diversity. Other area of reef concentration are the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, the Red Sea and the Caribbean, the latter having a much lower diversity than all major Indo-Pacific regions. The reefs and coral faunas of geological intervals are a combination of inheritance from the past and the outcome of more contemporary events. The distribution of modern reefs are an inheritance of the Tethys-dominated world of the Eocene, subsequently modified by the obliteration of both the Tethys Seaway (Miocene) and the Central American Seaway (Pliocene). Reefs and coral distributions It is true that without corals there can be no coral reefs, however it is not true that without reefs there are no corals. Rather the opposite: there are at least as many corals (excluding azooxanthellate species) growing in environments that will not support reef development as there are in environments that will. This is because of the constraints of temperature, light availability, sediment load, depth and (lack of) turbulence, all of which may act independently or in various combinations to prevent reef growth. These environmental constraints clearly interlink to produce habitats in which corals might flourish yet do not produce skeletons quickly enough to overcome erosion, or where encrusting coralline algae do not grow. Without the cementing action of algae, coral debris remains unconsolidated and can be swept away by storm waves. Many places where corals are abundant illustrate this; for example, the sea off the northern coast of central Australia is shallow and moderately turbid. There are no reefs, yet 60% of all Great Barrier Reef species grow there, some forming colonies as big and healthy as those on any reef. Long-term ecological issues aside, almost all species of Indo-Pacific corals grow as well in non-reef habitats as they do on reefs. Reefs and coral diversity These is a widely held misconception that reef growth is somehow dependent on coral diversity, probably stemming from the observation that most reefs occur where coral diversity is at least moderately high. However, reefs of the Caribbean have a lower diversity than most Indo-Pacific reefs, and well-formed reefs of the Abrolhos Islands of Brazil have less than 20 species. Clipperton Atoll in the far eastern Pacific has actively growing reefs which provide significant habitat diversity yet only seven species of coral occur there, just three of which contribute to reef-building. - Coral Fact Sheets (Australian Government / Australian Institute of Marine Science)",Indonesian/Philippines archipelago,0.144949913,364,398,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16137

They can sound like a buzzing or hissing noise and generally are most active during the peak of summer. If you look you will probably find their shells they have left behind after crawling out of the ground to start their second phase of life. (seen below) And here is one after leaving it's shell: You might watch this clip and see if it is a similar noise to what you are hearing. Summer Cicada sounds YouTube Additional information from comments: They are interesting creatures for sure, they live for up to 17 years, but once they crawl out of the ground and shed their shell and get wings, they only live for about 5 or more weeks in which they try and find a mate. Also a favorite food of copperhead snakes and the sole receptacle for cicada killer wasp larva, So they have tough lives once they crawl out of the ground. Cicada killers are a wasp species that uses these to house their larva, they sting them which paralyzes them and they drag them to their burrows where the wasp lays eggs in the still living cicada, its young then hatch later and eat the cicada for nutrition. The holes you find, if the size of your finger in width may be wasp burrows. There is usually but not always a pile of dirt around the hole that looks like it has been balled up. Additional cicada fun facts and life cycle information from Cicada Mania Cicadas are insects, best known for the songs sung by most, but not all, male cicadas. Males sing by flexing their tymbals, which are drum-like organs found in their abdomens. Small muscles rapidly pull the tymbals in and out of shape ‚Äî like the cap of a Snapple bottle. The sound is intensified by the cicada's mostly hollow abdomen. Female and some male cicadas will also make a sound by flicking their wings, but it isn't the same as the song cicadas are known for. Cicadas begin life as a rice-shaped egg, which the female deposits in a groove she makes in a tree limb, using her ovipositor. The groove provides shelter and exposes the tree fluids, which the young cicadas feed on. These grooves can kill small branches. When the branches die and leaves turn brown, it is called flagging. Once the egg hatches the cicada begins to feed on the tree fluids. At this point it looks like a termite or small white ant. Once the young cicada is ready, it crawls from the groove and falls to the ground where it will dig until it finds roots to feed on. Once roots are found the cicada will stay underground from 2 to 17 years depending on the species. Cicadas are active underground, tunneling and feeding. After the long 2 to 17 years, cicadas emerge from the ground as nymphs. Nymphs climb the nearest available tree, and begin to shed their nymph exoskeleton. Free of their old skin, their wings will inflate with fluid and their adult skin will harden. Once their new wings and body are ready, they can begin their brief adult life. Adult cicadas, also called imagoes, spend their time in trees looking for a mate. Males sing, females respond, mating begins, and the cycle of life begins again. Different Types of Life Cycles There are three types of cicada life cycles: Annual: Cicada species with annual life cycles emerge every year, for example, Swamp Cicadas (Neotibicen tibicen) emerge every year in the United States, and Green Grocers (Cyclochila australasiae) emerge every year in Australia. Periodical: Cicadas species with periodical life cycles emerge all together after long periods of time, for example, Magicicada septendecim will emerge every 17 years (Find out where they'll emerge next). Proto-periodical: Cicada species with proto-periodical life cycles might emerge every year, but every so many years they emerge in heavy numbers, like the Okanagana. Different Varieties How Many: There are over 190 varieties (including species & subspecies) of cicadas in North America, and over 3,390 varieties of cicadas around the world. This number grows each year as researchers discover and document new species. Cicadas exist on every continent but Antarctica. The Largest: The world's largest species of cicada is the Megapomponia imperatoria, which is native to Malaysia. The largest species in North America is Neotibicen auletes, aka the Northern Dusk Singing Cicada. The Loudest: According to the University of Florida Book of Insect Records, the Neotibicen pronotalis is the loudest cicada in North America, and can achieve 108.9 decibels. Australian species of cicadas, like the Double Drummer (Thopa saccata) are said to exceed 120 deafening decibels at close range. The loudest cicada in the world is supposed to be the Brevisana brevis, a cicada found in Africa. At a distance of 50cm (~20"") B. brevis reaches 106.7 decibels. Longest Lifecycle: The most well-known cicadas in the North America are the Magicicada periodical cicadas, aka ""locusts"", which have amazingly long 17 or 13 year lifecycles. Brood VI (17 year life cycle) will emerge in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in 2017. Read more about where and when. Edit for Sue: I found your question on the Cicada Mania site.

17476,,What is a nose-hooked carabiner and why is it dangerous?,it greatly weakens the carabiner,"To put it simply, it is when the nose of the carabiner gets hooked onto something, which reduces its strength dramatically. This happens by preventing the carabiner gate from closing and keeping it in a position that results in a catastrophic load pattern. This can happen for instance when sport climbing and one goes to clip a bolt and by mistake one does not pass the nose all the way through the bolt but rather the notch in the carabiner gets hooked on the gate. The reason that this is so dangerous is that it greatly weakens the carabiner. A carabiner's ""D"" shape is designed to put as much of the load force as possible along the spine opposite the gate. When hooked, the weight is placed on a weak position, with an additional torque placed into the material, which dramatically lowers the carabiner's weight carrying capability. Many carabiners will have markings for the rating along the spine with the gate closed, gate open, and with the carabiner sideways. Gate open and sideways is often less than a third the capacity of the carabiner properly loaded. When nose hooked, it's even worse. According to Black Diamond, But when you test a nose-hooked carabiner, it can fail at less than 10% of its rated closed gate strength ‚Äîthat's less than 2 kN (500 lbf or 227 kg) , a load that can be easily generated in even the smallest of climbing falls or even just a light bounce test .

So, if you are sweating minimally, you would need to drink about 1 liter of water per day to keep yourself well hydrated. You can know you are well hydrated, when you do not have any symptoms of dehydration (dry mouth, thirst, strong yellow urine, poor skin turgor ). About rationing water (only some theory at this point) Let's say you are a 70 kg with 60% , that is 42 kg (liters), of water in your body. Death can occur when you lose 20% (~8 liters) of the body water. If you lose 1 liter of water per day and drink 1 liter each day, 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of water would keep you well hydrated for 7.5 days. After that you will continue to lose 1 liter of water per day, you'll become progressively dehydrated, but you could survive for the additional 8 days , so 15.5 days in total. If you drink 0.5 liters per day from the beginning, it seems you will develop a negative balance of 8 liters of water in 16 days, so basically the same as in the above scenario. But, when you become dehydrated, you lose progressively smaller amounts of water , and this could make you survive a bit longer when you start to ration water from the beginning. However, as a result of rationing water, the toxic waste products (urea) will start to build in your blood. It's then the question about the balance of harms of the buildup of urea in your blood and benefits of the sparing of water by your kidneys. The question ""How much water should I ration myself each day?"" can be answered only by showing several convincing reports of how someone did it successfully (news reports...).

Your close reach may be better so you can flow over the waves. You will be a couple of points lower off the wind, so will need to tack more, but if your speed across the water makes up for this then that may be the way to go.

It would look like this, As far as the calculations go, if you are on course the back bearing should be 180 degrees to your direction of travel. So if you had started out on a course of 270 degrees, then the back bearing should be 90 degrees. Of course, you can also use the forward direction with your compass to navigate, but it can be nice to be able to take a back bearing in a situation like this and confirm that you are on the same heading as when you started.",90 degrees,0.355777204,865,875,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18970

21078,,What methods can be used to keep a cooler cold longer?,Packing tricks,"Ice Either obtain ice, or freeze ice packs (the latter are common in the UK, and many campsites will freeze them for you, often for a fee). Larger ice packs will keep partially frozen for 24 hours at moderate outside temperatures, while smaller ones can be tucked in the spaces in a nearly full cool box. If using ice, I prefer to keep it in a wide necked water bottle as not all containers are waterproof. Another solution is to nearly fill a (disposable) water bottle with water and freeze it. Both ice packs and ice in containers stay frozen a little longer than loose ice, because there's an extra thermal barrier between them and the outside world. Traditional cooling Shade is good, but not if its an enclosed space like a tent, or if it ceases to be shade at the hottest part of the day. Choose wisely. Tree shade is often good, or underneath a vehicle. An old method is a wet towel over the top of your container, especially if there's a bit of a breeze. You may want to arrange it so the towel hangs into a dish of water to keep it wet unattended. Evaporative cooling is quite effective (similarly you can cool down drinks by wrapping them in wet cloth and leaving them in the breeze). This is applicable in a vehicle too - an open window or cold air vent blowing over the wet towel would help, or strapping the towel round it and putting it in the bed of a truck (it will dry pretty quickly). Sitting the cool box in shallow running water is another traditional trick - just so long as it doesn't leak. Packing tricks You don't want to let ice or ice packs touch your salad or fruit, as they will spoil. However these don't need to be kept as cold. Neither do most drinks. Pack those round the outside and in the middle, pack the things that do need to be kept cold (meat, dairy) and your ice packs/containers of ice. In a vehicle, additional insulation is fairly easy to arrange. Pack the cool box in between tents/kit bags, and you'll find that by the time you get there the outside of the cool box is quite a bit cooler than ambient, demonstrating that the surrounding materials insulate this. On a warm humid day, you can get condensation between the coolbox and the things surrounding it, so be careful; you might not want to place you sleeping bag there.",Packing tricks,0.059790935,1513,1527,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21078
21371,,What is the best method for protecting my bees from pesticides?,contact the farmers,"It looks like there isn't much you can do because most of it depends on the farmers. With that said, The farther colonies are away from fields or orchards that are treated with pesticides, the better chance the bees have against pesticide poisoning. Establish apiaries at least 4 miles from crops being treated with toxic materials and subjected to drift. However, if your apiary is already located in an agricultural area where pesticide use is high, moving your bees may be the best insurance against future pesticide kills since preventing honey bees from foraging on pesticide-contaminated flowers is almost impossible. If moving is impossible, covering colonies with a well-ventilated screen to restrict honey bee flight during peak foraging hours may be your only course of action. However, this method has dangerous side effects and could lead to higher mortality than would have occurred from pesticide exposure. Colonies may have difficulty controlling their hive temperature when confined and can easily overheat, so care must be taken. Providing water inside the screen will allow the bees to reduce temperatures. Do not keep the colony covered for more than two days. Covering the colonies with large wet burlap sacks and providing them with shade is another method for preventing overheating. Protecting Pollinators from Pesticides Do not leave unmarked colonies of bees next to orchards or fields. Post your name, address, and phone number in printing large enough to be read at some distance in all apiaries so you can be contacted readily to move the colonies when hazardous sprays are to be applied. ... Cover honey bee colonies with wet burlap for two or three days to protect them from the initial hazards of an insecticide. Such covers should be put over the hives during the night before the crop is treated and should be kept wet during use. This method works; however, most beekeepers find it impractical.

The point of building redundancy is exactly for this scenario. Sometimes anchors fail. If you've built your belay correctly then losing one anchor in a 3-point belay should have no effect on you or your partners. Just carry on belaying. This is exactly why you must balance your anchors correctly. If you're worried about all your anchors failing then why are you belaying here at all! If you're forced into this scenario (which seems very unlikely unless you're leading a brand new pitch on the Eiger), add more anchors (5+) and certainly don't belay 2 people at once. What should I instruct B and C to do? Nothing. What would be the point?! Let them carry on climbing as normal. So if one point breaks, this will not be a catastrophic failure. This is a little wrong: the point of redundancy is that if one piece fails, nothing happens , at all. Catastrophic or not.

Hunting towers are used for boar, not far away in Germany (they give a good view, and the shot is downwards meaning that a miss hits the ground). Bait is sometimes used with them.

25013,,What do I do if I see a murder hornet outside?,report it to your state's Department of Agriculture,"I'm assuming for this answer that you are based in the USA, and have read the recent NY times article on ""Murder Hornets"" Like most wasp species, you are at little risk unless you are disturbing its nest or happen to accidentally cause it to think it is being attacked (e.g. it lands on your side without you knowing and you lower your arm onto it). The best thing to do is treat them as you would any other wasp - move slowly away, let it fly around you if it wants to. Note that your chances of being attacked in the USA or Canada are very very very low - there is no evidence (yet) that they have become established in the Pacific North West. Also note (as Wikipedia says): Since 2001, the yearly human death toll caused by stings of bees, wasps and hornets in Japan has been ranging between 12 and 26. Since this number also includes deaths caused by wasps, bees and other hornet species, the number of deaths caused by Asian giant hornets is likely significantly lower. Advice in China is that people stung more than 10 times need medical help, and need emergency treatment for more than 30 stings. The stings can cause kidney failure. In 2013, stings by Asian giant hornets killed 41 people and injured more than 1,600 people in Shaanxi, China. Japan has a population of around 126 million - with around 26 dying of stings each year - around 1 in 20 million chance. Note that similar rates are found for bee/wasp/hornet stings in the USA . For comparison, the car crash fatality rate in the USA is 12.4/100,000, so your risk of death/injury from these insects in particular is very very low. Edited to add - If you sight one, you should report it to your state's Department of Agriculture , especially if you are not from Washington State. There is also a common species of solitary wasp, known by the common name Cicada Killer , which are large (up to 2""/5 cm) and often ""buzzes"" people - but rarely stings.

455,,What are the most important indicators of an high-risk avalanche zone?,Group dynamics and decision making,"To expand a bit on the good answer already given: Slope - 25-45 degrees is a good broad suggestion, but your region of the country will have a big impact on this. Maritime snow is wetter and stickier, so tends to be most dangerous at steeper angles. Transitional and Continental snow is less wet, so has a most dangerous slope range on the lower end of the scale. Find out more specific information from the avalanche center closest to your location. Any rapid changes to snow position, temperature, or sun. Lots of fresh snow, lots of wind moving snow around, a rapid change in temperature can all increase avalanche danger. The avalanche dragon hates change, and it makes him angry. Stable conditions are less likely to enrage him. ""Whumfing"", cracking or visible settling. All very serious danger signs. Avalanche chutes - look for places where avalanches have happened in the past, by looking for debris, or places where there are no big trees all of a sudden. But also look for evidence of recent avalanches. Check high slopes above you all the time - if you see a few fresh looking slides, that is a huge danger sign. Forgetting the snow for a moment, remember that an avalanche fatality requires two things - snow conditions, and a person to be there. Avalanche deaths are primarily men, aged 20-29, who are experienced skiers. Not because avalanches like these people more, but because they are most likely to find themselves in a risky location, doing a risky thing. Group dynamics and decision making will have a greater impact on your survival than snow science (though that is important, too). In nearly all avalanche fatalities, the investigation finds that someone in the group either identified the hazard, or had sufficient training to identify the hazard, and yet the group did the dangerous thing anyway. Evaluate your group and make some rules: Everyone has veto power on dangerous situations. Make several plans. Instead of ""we are gonna ski that wicked bowl"", decide on a few options in different locations so if one area looks dangerous you are comfortable changing plans. Don't get lulled into a false sense of security by good weather, or having an ""expert"" in the group. Everyone's eyes are open, and everyone discusses the situation as they see it. Don't get macho - if the conditions don't feel right, its fine to turn back. When they say ""go big or go home"", remember that sometimes it's just fine to go home. ;) And finally - take a class. Depending on where you are, there are probably some good Level 1 or introductory courses available free or inexpensively. Bring your friends, too - being trained on avalanche safety doesn't make YOU safer, it makes your friends safer.

However there are techniques which will make it easier to get back in your boat safely. Note : All of these should first be practiced in mildly shallow water, in flat water. Don't practice in rough water until you can achieve these in flat water. However no self rescue can be called confident until you can reliably perform it in conditions rougher than you like to paddle in. You are most likely to capsize in rough conditions, not flat water, so work up to the challenging stuff. With a partner or group. Second note : No amount of reading or self study is substitute for a good teacher, and practical experience. Don't think that because you read this article that you now are competent in self rescue. You can only get that from practice. Join a paddle club, and get face to face assistance . Now that's out of the way... From easiest to most challenging... Note : All except the wet entrance and roll should be attempted with a partially empty boat. Do this by tipping the boat from the bow with your body weight and using a quick flip. Ladder Crawl Beginning from the back of the boat: Stow your paddle in the deck rigging, to get it out of your way, and prevent losing it. Orient so that bow is perpendicular to the prevailing direction of the waves. Holding the stern, use your body weight to bring the stern under the surface. Wait for a swell to raise the boat bow further, then make a quick kick with your feet, and launch your torso on top of the stern decking. Keep your body low, and your legs wide in the water. Slowly work forward to the cockpit, staying low. Drop your butt into the cockpit Kick your legs over the cockpit combing and into the boat. Pump out remaining water, and reapply the spray skirt. Rodeo Same as above, store your paddle in the deck rigging, try to make it perpendicular to the boat. Orient the boat so that the bow and stern are in line with the direction of prevailing waves. Approach the stern of the boat perpendicularly and grab onto the safety lines , not bungees along the sides of the boat. Wait for a wave to raise the bow, then launch your torso onto the stern deck. Kick one leg over the stern and orient with your head towards the bow. Follow steps 4-8 above in ""The Ladder"" Side-entry without float Insert paddle into rigging, behind cockpit, and twist to lock into place. Orient with paddle blade face, "" Feathered "" against the water. (Increases resistance after weighting, lowering roll chances) 2.Place leg on top of paddle, grab cock pit combing, and kick opposite leg up and into the cock pit. You will end up face down, looking toward the stern of the boat. Bring other leg into cock pit ( quickly ), and twist body to orient towards the bow ( slowly ). Remove paddle from rigging. Pump out remaining water and re-apply spray skirt. Re-entry and Roll Note : This is a move usually only achievable by someone with a semi-consistent roll. Also, do not worry about the water in the cockpit unless it is completely full. Water can actually help, because the boat will sit lower in the water. Leave the boat turned upside down. ( Do not flip right side up!) Orient the boat so that the bow and stern are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the waves. Waves should be washing over the side of the boat. (Usually a bad thing) Align yourself along the side of the boat, and grab the cockpit combing with your inside hand. Slide your legs into the cockpit partially. Take a breath and slide your legs all the way into the cock pit while submerging your body under the water. Take your paddle, align it parallel to the boat so that your lead hand (strong) is forward. In a fast but consistent motion make a 180 degree arc. Use the weak hand as a fulcrum. Let the strong hand break the surface of the water. At 90 degrees drive lead hand underwater by arcing your back and plunging your body deeper under water. Complete the motion , and finish with your back near the stern of the boat. Your boat (with any practice and luck) will be on top of the water right side up. Empty the boat of water, and re-apply the spray skirt. Next time paddle with a buddy, and a paddle float.

Whether there is a significant reduction in mosquitoes, black flies, or leeches that stems from wearing different colors, I have not noticed... and since it only takes one malaria (other disease) infested mosquito biting you to infect you, your best bet is to use a DEET based repellent. As far as other impacts go, bright colors make you more visible to animals and birds, thus reduce your chances of seeing them. Dark colors, camouflage and the like can help increase your odds of seeing the illusive rain forest residents. That reason alone informs my wardrobe choice.

Typically it will be made in a way that the poles will naturally erect the tent so all you need to do is take it out of its bag and then peg it to the ground. The major downside is that taking it down requires some effort and technique to twist and fold it into its packed configuration. Typically they can't be made that big either, as the springy poles could get tangled in a complex configuration.

3423,,What dried vegetarian foods have the highest ratio of calories to volume?,Raisins and nuts,"A recent article on The Out Side Out blog by Reiner Thoni ( ""Fast and Light"" Plant Based Nutrition for Mountaineering ) has quite a bit of detail on this, and goes well into the details of a balanced diet and some options for variety. The following is quoted verbatim: Carbohydrates - replacing the glycogen reserves - 4cal/gram Lets start with Couscous , it packs easy, is more nutritious then pasta and prepares instantly making it a corner stone carbohydrate for replacing glycogen reserves in the muscles. When on longer trips where variety is important or with people who are gluten intolerant/celiac steamed quinoa and millet also work but are more expensive and not as readily available. Western couscous variety's are pre steamed so you just need to add hot water and wait 5 min. Casbah sells flavored variety's in 7 oz (200g) bags/box's with flavors like, Lemon Spinach, Wild Forest Mushroom, Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil or Nuts, Currants and Spice . These are organic, simple but healthy meals that you can purchase for under 5 dollars and all that is lacking when compared to freeze dried packaged dinners is a bunch of ingredients that you cant pronounce plus the extra dollars. Its no wonder Conrad Ankor said couscous, couscous, cousous and more couscous when asked what he was eating for dinner on there 12 day assault of the sharks fin on Meru Central's (6310m) massive east face wall. Put simply it works.... Add organic freeze dried packages of mashed potatoes for variety and difference in consistency. Now your probably wondering... right just eat couscous with some potatoes and you will be prancing up the mountain. Well to be honest you have 1/3 of what you need and are missing complete proteins, certain fats and vital minerals and vitamins. Like an orchestra you need all your members in order to realize the magic. Proteins - rebuilding and sustained energy 4cal/gram All the food mentioned in this blog post will contain a certain amount of protein but to ensure complete proteins and enough to aid in recovery I like to fix up a special bag. Garden of life makes an exceptional organic Raw sprouted protein that with its natural enzymes makes its very easy to digest. Also added are sprouts, cereal grass juices, fruits, spirulina, chlorella along with probiotics, fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. This makes it a very special bag that supports your nutrition in many ways while remaining extremely light. To bulk it up a little I sometimes add hemp seeds which are also high in complete proteins. Fats 9cal/gram Fat is vital to our survival and is the highest calorie to weight food component so its definitely a key part of the package. During a bout of low intensity exercise of long duration fatty acid oxidation can contribute 50per cent of the energy expenditure. The rest of the energy must come from carbs and the higher the intensity the more carbs are needed. Luckily a large part of mountaineering is low intensity and high fat foods can be readily utilized. My go to fat is nuts and I like to take a variety of organic nuts to take advantage of each unique nutrient profile. Filling a ziplock bag with brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, walnuts, pine nuts, and filberts you have a quick and easy fat source. Because most nuts are high in omega 6 fatty acids (inflammatory) I like to balance it out with chia seeds which are in turn very high in omega 3 ( anti inflammatory). Chia seeds are normally added to my "" special bag"". Another fat that I take along is coconut oil to add to my soups and dinners improving the taste and aroma while adding a few extra calories. Minerals I love making hot soup and taking a pack of 6 organic veggie bouillon cubs it supplies you with a tone of minerals. Add some spinach couscous and coconut oil improving texture and more flavor. I also like to take rock salt to add to food and water for improved hydration and taste. Vitamins Testing many brands I find it very important to find a multi vitamin that is raw with enzymes to allow maximum absorption. GOL seems to put the most emphasis on maximum absorption and has a couple products that meet up to the test, Living Multi along with the perfect food greens formula. I also like to take Wobenzum to help ensure joint health especially for those long descents with big packs. Additional well balanced foods 60-70% carb, 15-20% fat, 15-20% protein. For breakfast I turn to Oatmeal and to avoid starting the stove up in the morning I prepare it the night before and let it soak over night in a sealed container inside the bivi. Containing 70% carbs 15% fat 15% protein it is well balanced but I like to add some special bag mix to it and let it all soak together for improved taste and nutrition. Raisins and nuts are also a great addition. Lunch time doesn't really exist while on the mountain as it's important to fuel the body consistently through out the day. I fill my chest pockets with GOL living food bars I like to eat about 1/2 a bar per hour. Sweetened with honey they contain powerful antioxidants with antiseptic and antibacterial properties and along with many other organic wholesome ingredients (including Fiber) they make for a perfect go to bar that sits well in the stomach and keeps you regular. When the opportunity arises to put the pack down I will eat some nuts and even whip up a quick batch of soup if there is enough time. I always keep a couple emergency gels in my waist pocket on my pack. Finally for further hydration and immunity boost I like to brew up some echinacea tea with rock salt.",Raisins and nuts,0.485925436,4724,4740,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3423
3441,,What are the key factors when choosing a sleeping bag for backpacking?,Warmth,"Warmth -- This is after all why you are buying the bag. Not all bags rated for the same temperature will provide the same warmth . Fit -- A bag that fits you closely, but not tightly, will provide better insulation and is more comfortable in my view. For this reason I prefer mummy bags. Rectangle bags will provide more movement room, but will generally be heavier and colder. Weight -- Depending on how far you are hiking, the weight may matter anywhere from a lot, to hardly at all. Fill Material -- Down or Synthetic. Down will generally compress more and offer more warmth for the weight, while synthetic will cost less and handle damp better. Look out when buying down bags, as I have noticed a lot of bags lately using duck down instead of goose down. Duck down is not as warm as goose down. Performence when wet -- While down compresses better, it is not known for it's warmth when soaking wet. In high humidity situations, or in any case where you are concerned about your bag getting soaked, you may prefer synthetic fill. Compression -- This is a function of your other gear. I have a very small pack which will not fit any bag that does not pack down to a pretty small size. I don't list cost because I approach it from the ""determine what I need, then find one that fits my budget"" approach. That often means buying sales or second hand.

3730,,"What do you do if the fire does get ""out of control""?",evacuate,"I see three priorities: Make sure no one gets hurt Make sure possessions needed for survival (food, tents) are not destroyed Make sure the fire doesn't spread further and become a forest fire If the campsite you're using is an officially-sanctioned one, this last is probably the least likely to be a problem. You have a large group of people, so you can tackle all of these things at once as long as you take control and give people things to do . Don't say ""somebody X!"" Turn to someone and say ""Steve, X! Susan, Y!"" and so on. The things they need to do (pretty much all in parallel, but listed in priority order) are: put shoes on get large containers (buckets, washing up bowls) of water if the source is near enough - ten or twenty steps - to make running back and forth with water reasonable take towels and blankets to the water to drench them for use as smotherers get small children or injured people well out of the way of both the fire and the people who are dealing with it, including out of the path to the water, and for small children, leave someone in charge of them so they stay out of the way move tents or packs that appear to be in the way or in danger throw water on the edges of the fire, then run back to refill the container use large wet towels, coats or non-polymer blankets, tarps etc to smother flames if possible, then pick up the slightly singed smotherer and do it again somewhere else. Resoak as needed move benches and other fireplace furniture out of the way of the people who are running around with water and smothering-blankets Watch while this is happening and evaluate. You may need to get some people to start taking children, packs, and tents down to the water and loading them into canoes, or out to a road or other less-likely to burn spot from where you can leave or be rescued. There may also be someone kicking up a fuss about something not critical for survival that is in danger - a stuffed animal, or a book - and you may be able to delegate someone to deal with that, or to tell the wailer ""we have to concentrate on keeping it from spreading to the tents!"" which should keep the noise level down if nothing else. If anyone is hurt, getting someone to start giving them first aid is also a good idea if you have spare people with no buckets or smothering-blankets to use and no other duties like moving stuff to be done first. You also have to decide if things have reached the ""call 911"" stage and if so, direct someone to do so. This may involve telling them where to find a phone. Keep directing people, keep watching if it's getting bigger or smaller, keep aware of how many people are in danger and which possessions are in danger, and either you will get it back under control or you will evacuate to whatever extent you can. True story: a family member was in a tent/cabin (permanent structure, canvas walls and roof) that caught fire in the night while winter camping. He carried his sleeping bag with him on the way out; he doesn't know why. Without that, as they stood in the pitch black cold (-10C) , hours from help with no food, water, or first aid, only the clothes they had been sleeping in, the two burned teens would, everyone agrees, have died.

3851,,"What kinds of things are the ""defensive driving"" equivalent to handling campfires?",being prepared if all goes south in a hurry,"First, lets dispel a common myth: Rock fire rings do absolutely nothing to contain, corral, or control a fire. That being said, a fire needs 3 things: air, fuel, and heat. An overabundance of one will create an uncontrollable fire. Thus, keep the following in mind: Consult the local fire conditions. Public lands agencies will rate the fire conditions. Heed their warnings. Don't build a fire in high winds. Sparks can be thrown hundreds of meters into dry tinder and start a fire Be aware of fuel nearby - anything organic that touches or is near your fire can combust. Tall grasses, shrubs, even roots that cross from your fire to a fuel source can create issues. Look for overhanging branches above your fire. Keep your fire small. There is no need for 10foot flames. Smaller fires have less likelihood of throwing sparks or torching nearby vegetation Burn nothing larger than the diameter of your wrist -- this allows for both a clean burn (no hot logs that you will be tempted to leave behind), and helps keep a fire low Break or cut wood so that it fits within your fire -- sticking a 20ft log in one end and burning it down is a bad idea Consider using a fire blanket under your fire to reduce the chance of igniting below ground roots (which also reduces fire scars) Consider alternatives: a small candle, a lamp. I've backpacked professionally for 15 years and haven't had a fire in the back-country in the last 14. Addendum: Being ""defensive"" also means being prepared if all goes south in a hurry. Have water, or a bucket of sand/non-organic soil nearby to help stop spot fires if it escapes your ring.

If they attack and you can't get away, how to avoid them hitting your thigh. I believe the main risk for boars is their tusks piercing your thigh and artery which can cause you to bleed to death much quicker than getting help is possible. update: It may be worth taking into account that in some places animals can become more agressive as they lose their fear of humans. Here in Europe hunters may feed animals to create artificial overpopulations, which in some places has resulted in the boars affiliating humans with food.

It will literally rub away skin (I've had this happen). Sweat, dirt, and bacteria will all be against and open wound in a warm damp environment (your shoe). You will get an infection. Because feet don't heal quickly or well, the infection will get worse. Eventually you'll have to see a doctor to remove the infected tissue (this actually happened to AWOL, which he describes in his book). Should you be insane enough to continue (this would usually take days) then you'll get a blood infection. Is that an extreme end result? Yes. It never happens really because ""walking through the pain"" at that point would be nigh impossible and take an extreme level of willful disregard for your health. Regarding long term effects, you could have long term effects from even your 30km walk. At about stage three (direct friction to raw skin) you could easily get scarring.

It is often also named ""sewn-through"", e.g. in this article . In contrary the other chamber constructions are built in a way that the chambers have some overlap of loft material to prevent thermal bridges. This does also mean that inner and outer fabric do not share common seams. The drawback of the ""X"" construction compared to the other construction types (""H"", ""V"" etc.) is that the sleeping bag has no insulating material at the seams which reduces the thermal insulation. The advantage is that it is lighter than the other constructions as there is no additional fabric needed besides the inner and outer shells to form three dimensional chambers.

Lightning shouldn't hit the tent directly,"The first thing to do is to not pitch your tent in the middle of a flat area when there is a chance of thunderstorms. Sometimes that's not so easy, but that doesn't make it any less a good thing to do. For a properly sited tent, the best thing to do during a thunderstorm is to stay put. Lightning shouldn't hit the tent directly, but it could hit something else nearby. That can cause large ground currents, which causes voltage over a distance accross the ground. Inside your sleeping bag on a insulated pad on top of the tent floor should be fairly safe from voltages caused by large ground currents. If you are in badly sited tent, like in the middle of a flat area with the tent being the tallest thing around, then staying put inside your sleepping bag is still the best thing to do in a bad circumstance. If lightning does strike your tent, then there is at least some chance the current will be conducted by the wet skin of the tent or the tent poles (if metal). This will make the current go around you instead of thru you to the ground. It will be very unpleasant nonetheless, but still a whole lot better than getting zapped directly.

(Easy to translate to paper maps, define search areas, and calculate distances.) If you use the WGS84 datum, the numerical portions are also identical with the military grid reference system (MGRS) and the national grid (USNG). In my area the local mountain rescue groups (BAMRU, Tahoe Nordic) use UTM. That said, aircraft and ships at sea usually prefer latitude and longitude values as the numbers don't ""reset"" when you cross zones, and they are usually covering much greater distances than people on land. Per the addendum I added at the end, the recommended format is degrees and decimal minutes. The linked PDF suggests reading coordinates as in the following example (for 39¬∞ 36.06‚ÄôN by 76¬∞ 51.42‚ÄôW): ‚ÄúThree nine degrees, three six decimal zero six minutes North by seven six degrees, five one decimal four two minutes West.‚Äù Regardless of coordinate system, have the person on the other end repeat the numbers back to you; this is one set of numbers you don't want to have an error. Writing down your message before communicating will also help you with a poor connection or low batteries as you'll avoiding wasting time trying to remember what else you need to communicate. Finally, as others mentioned, the dispatcher should be able to handle any coordinate format, and any search teams will be using topo maps and translating the coordinates to their preferred format. (They are usually familiar with the areas they regularly work in.) Addendum: I suspected that [within the US] UTM was becoming a SAR standard, as a quick Google suggests that to be the case. Further digging indicates the National Search and Rescue Committee has designated the US National Grid (USNG) system as the standard coordinate system for land-based SAR in the United States, and latitude and longitude (in decimal minutes) for aircraft and boats. This does not mean that some (many?) local agencies are no longer using their older preferred systems; full compliance is probably many years away. If you want to know more about USNG, I suggest posting a separate question, but here's a comparison: USNG: 18S UJ 23371 06519 MGRS: 18SUJ2337106519 UTM: 18 323371 4306519 (Note that USNG and MGRS use a letter pair for the 100km grid squares whereas UTM doesn't; UTM instead has additional digits.

7217,,"What is the first thing to do, when buried in an avalanche?",stay calm and breath slow,"The correct answer is to put your avalung mouthpiece in your mouth and inflate your airbag . If you don't have either of those things, then you are NOT properly equipped to be in avalanche terrain. If you get caught in an avalanche when you are not properly equipped , then the best you can do is 'swim' like crazy to try and keep yourself afloat, and then bury your face into your arms as though you are sneezing and inflate your lungs as much as you can before you come to a stop. This will hopefully prevent suffocation from the snow pack squeezing the air out of you, as well as provide you with a small pocket of air in front of your face and give you a couple more minutes of breathing. It will also give you the use of your arms when you stop. You will not necessarily be able to create an air pocket afterwards, when an avalanche settles it can be as hard as concrete. Be sure to keep your mouth closed while you're in an avalanche as well, people have been extracted from avalanches with snow packed all the way down their throats to their stomaches, and up into their sinuses. If you are skiing, you want to drop your poles and try to get your skis off if you can, they will only act as anchors and drag you down leaving you buried deeper. If you want to experience getting caught in a tiny avalanche via GoPro, watch this video. This guy only got buried less than a metre deep in a small, slow avalanche of light fluffy snow, but he's still pretty helpless. This situation would afford you more time because the snow isn't packed, which gives you more breathing time because there is more air in the snow. You'll notice he is also able to create a pocket of air around his face, which isn't always possible. This doesn't give you more air to breathe, it merely displaces the existing air in the snow and helps dissipate the CO2 that you are exhaling (this is what the Avalung does, it vents your exhaled air behind you to prevent CO2 buildup around your face-which can give you over a half hour of additional breathing time) . This guy probably could have dug himself out at this depth, but he didn't pop out of his skis, which I bet are anchoring him down in the snow. He also knows that his friends saw him get buried and aren't far away, so he's playing it smart and conserving oxygen by not struggling. It's important to stay calm and breath slow when you're buried in an avalanche, panicking will only kill you faster. When you train for avalanche rescue you're taught that you have about 15 minutes from time of burial before the victim runs out of oxygen. So no matter what you do, in an avalanche, your life still depends on your friends finding you, so you'd better have your beacon on, with new batteries in it, and the people you're with had better know how to preform a rescue. NEVER go into avalanche terrain with out having proper avalanche training.

8198,,What are the main differences between dehydrated foods and freeze-dried foods?,cost,"The most significant difference between the two‚Äîaside from cost‚Äîis the composition of the food due to the different processes of removing moisture. Dehydration very simply uses heat to remove moisture without cooking the food. This leaves the food withered and hard, and takes a lot longer to rehydrate. Freeze-drying involves cooling the food inside a vacuum below freezing, then rapidly heating it to above boiling point, the vacuum then sucks out the moisture as a gas. The significant difference is that the freeze dried food retains its structure, and accepts moisture like a sponge. Dehydrated foods do not so readily accept moisture. As a result freeze dried foods will rehydrate or ""cook"" much faster. The main differences: DEHYDRATION Moisture content: 5 - 10% Shelf life: 15-20 years (fruits and veggies) Nutritional value: Dehydration process breaks down vitamins and minerals; retains less nutritional content. Appearance and composition: Withered and hard Cooking: 15min - 4hrs; takes a long time to re-hydrate; bland flavour, requires seasoning. Cost: Dehydrating food is easy and cheap; dehydrators are relatively inexpensive and can be easily homemade using a box and space heater, or even the sun. Pros: Cheaper, simpler process; easy and inexpensive to dehydrate home-made foods. Cons: Longer preparation times; retains less nutritional content; heavier to carry. FREEZE DRYING Moisture content: 1 - 2% (significantly less weight) Shelf life: 25-30 years (fruits and veggies) Nutritional value: Vast majority of the vitamins and minerals found in the original food is retained. Appearance and composition: Moisture is removed from the food without destroying it's structure; becomes soft when wet. Cooking: 5min - 10min; better flavor. Cost: Freeze-drying food is not as cheap as dehydrating it; dryers are high tech and cost thousands of dollars, and use more power than dehydrators.

As the name says, they build nests underground, usually in sandy ground. The other big difference between them and regular honey bees, is that they are so-called solitary bees, so they do not form hives. The nest is built by a single female, who lays eggs in several chambers and provides each with pollen and nectar. So since they do not form hives, they never really become a nuisance, and they provide good pollination for plants.

11124,,What should I do when in an unintentional contact with a bear?,clean that up if you can,"It kind of depends on which bear, black bears are one thing and brown bears another. And lets say that you have actually taken all the precautions to not attract a bear in your camp in first place, a bear wont be going through your pack in search of your iPod. First be aware of your surroundings when you set up camp, so you know where to move. Give a look around as there might be cubs, you don‚Äôt want to move towards those. If you can walk away do so, slowly, walking not running and always face the animal, be careful where you put your feet, you don‚Äôt want to trip and fall. Keep your deterrent ready for use. Do not move in a direction that would make the animal think you are gonna take/protect a source of food. When you first see the animal don‚Äôt make sudden movements or noises, if surprised it will go on the defensive. If its a black bear he might already decide to move out seeing you, if you want to try to make him move out then the idea is to make yourself look bigger and make a lot of noise. Keep deterrent ready. Before deciding to move any bear out of camp make really sure it has an escape route, if the animal feels trapped things wont go well. Usually black bears wont test you unless its a female that is trying to defend their cubs. They normally don‚Äôt see people as food. Brown bears instead are a whole different story, the theory goes as above but forget making them move out of camp and to that you add the probable play dead emergency thing, it seems the problem with that is that people don‚Äôt wait long enough before restarting moving and the animal comes back but I‚Äôm not sure how much one can actually play dead waiting for their soiled pants to hit the fan. Obviously the best thing is to not have the bear in camp, no food should stay in the camp, same goes for soap, toothpaste, toiletries etc. For the same reason, food that cant be prepared in a ""clean"" way shouldn‚Äôt be prepared at or near the camp (fish cleaning for example), don‚Äôt smear food on you (your clothes aren‚Äôt a napkin for cleaning bacon grease from your fingers) etc etc. Give a look around the camp area for what people camping there might have left/buried, clean that up if you can. (lots of people think that since they are leaving they can be sloppy) A bit of reading: http://www.grizzlydiscoveryctr.org/education/bear-awareness-hiking-camping/ http://www.bearsmart.com/play/bear-encounters/ A video: http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000000812441/stephen-herrero-on-black-bear-attacks.html As for deterrents: bear spray!!! Guns yes, they are guns etc etc but: unless you shoot and kill things can go downhill fast. Plenty of guns enthusiasts handle guns and know how to shoot at a target, hunters are used to the gun etc. All more or less controlled situations, a bear coming at you is way different matter, not easy to keep calm. Not all guns would be effective on a bear so you have to consider that too. If you camp with family and friends or all have a gun and know how to use it under pressure or its pointless, many times one has a gun the rest nothing, he cant be guarding both camp and somebody that is taking a bathroom break and if something happens to that person its done. Bear spray is inexpensive enough that everyone in the group can have a can, even a kid can carry it and learn to use it properly. It doesn‚Äôt kill the animal either (and if a nervous trigger happy element accidentally sprays another member of the group is not a disaster like if they had a gun) If you read the accident reports there have been people defending themselves with guns and it worked, but usually they had time to do so and they were experienced. In many cases people don‚Äôt have the time to get the gun, and if they did they didn‚Äôt have the time or capacity to aim it properly. With the spray there have been also accidents were they had it and didn‚Äôt have the time to get at it, but in the cases they got it ready it worked because it was just point towards the animal -> shoot.

13283,,What should I do to avoid ticks other than wear particular clothing?,check yourself often,"You will pick up ticks by spending a lot of time outdoors, but I routinely find them after walking across 10 ft of grass between my car and my front door. No matter how much prevention you practice, keep an eye out for Lyme symptoms, and go to the doctor for antibiotics if they show up. A vaccine would be much nicer. The socks-in-your pants method is very popular, but I've never been convinced it actually works: I usually find ticks around my head and neck, and deer ticks (the type that spread Lyme disease) are so tiny that it takes very little for them to hide. I feel like I'd need a skin tight light colored jumpsuit for this to be truly effective. Lighter colored clothing makes it easier to see ticks, but they still look like specks of dirt. DEET is very effective against mosquitoes, but only slightly effective against ticks. Permethrin treated clothing is much, much more effective. You can buy treated clothing (such as InsectShield), or you can buy the chemical and do it yourself (Read all instructions carefully). I don't have the reference with me, but I read one study where ticks that walked on the clothing fell off and died within a foot of crawling. This is what I prefer to use when I'm hiking. Treated pants at the least, and a treated shirt if it's available. The other thing to do is check yourself often. Look at your legs and clothing every time you stop. When you stop for the day, look yourself over as much as possible. If you don't have a mirror, have someone else check your back, where you can't see. Ticks prefer to hang out on the tips of plants, usually in the sun. They have an instinct to reach the highest places possible. This does not mean you won't find them in the shade, but if you walk through a sunny field during tick season, you've got a very good chance of picking one or more up. They prefer to bite you in the warmest places possible, ideally someplace with some cover.

13846,,What should I look for in my first pair of snowboard boots?,bombproof hold,"First of all: the boots are the most important equipment for snowboarding! It's good to read something about it but please go to a real board-shop before purchasing them! Choose one of those fancy ones where guys hang around listening to punk/rap-music :) The common ski- or sport-shops are in general not that reliable when it comes to snowboarding. The other considerations are summed up in this article from the Austrian board-shop ""Blue Tomato"" : Most important: the size The most important criterion when buying a new boot is the right size. The Mondo point size, the length of your foot, is a good guideline. When your legs are straight, you may touch the front of your boot lightly. However, when you bend your knees this should not happen. Pay attention that your heel is snug in the boot and cannot move. Boots of different brands do not have the same length and width, so keep in mind that the boot should also fit your binding. Some brands use half-size liners in their outer shoes. If you have large feet but do not want to ride a wide board, you can save important millimetres in toe- and heel area with this information. The flex value Snowboard boots are available as hard- and soft boots. For freestyle as well as freeride, you use soft boots. They are available in different flex rates: softer boots for freestyle and harder boots for freeride. Hard boots are solely for racing and carving. They greatly restrict the freedom of movement, so that you can bring pressure to the edge, even at high speed. As you've described that you want to ride on the slope and a little backcountry, I would choose a flex value of 7. Lacing The lacing of your snowboard boots is essential for the hold. As a rule, you can distiguish three different lacing systems: traditional lacing, quick lacing systems and Boa. So the question is: what is the perfect system for you? We will explain this! The classic among lacing systems is still the first choice for many riders. No other system can adjust the pressure as well as with the old-school variant. The laces have a solid core that prevents the knot from loosening. The soft coat gives the necessary grip to your fingers to get a bombproof hold. Okay, if you ride really hard, you‚Äôll probably have to readjust them during the day. The quick lacing systems, speed lacing, have become a fixed part of the sport. Nowadays there is an almost bewildering array, from ‚Äútwin lacing‚Äù to ‚Äúspeed zone‚Äù. The principle is the same for all of them, but, depending on the price range, you get a system for the whole shoe, two divided speed-lacing systems for the top and bottom of the boot or even a three-part system with extra lacing for more heel-hold. With these systems, you thread the laces through plastic- or metal devices, tighten them to the desired level and secure them in the device. This only takes a few seconds. The more zones the system has, the more accurately you can adjust the boot to your foot and preferences. Superficially, BOA is a quick lacing system. The only difference is that it uses wire and wheels. Depending on the price range the BOA system also offers, one, two or even three adjuster wheels for the different areas of the boot and often even for the liner. Turning the wheel tightens the bootlaces evenly; pushing the button loosens the wire again. You can also use this system easily while wearing gloves. When it comes to hold, BOA is the first choice. It is not the fastest system to tighten, but it is number one to loosen: one button-push and the wire is loosened! A few words on the Liner The liner is included with your snowboard boots. It increases the comfort of the fairly hard outer boot. Several models even have a thermo liner, which you can heat-mould to match the shape of your foot. If you are prone to pressure points or particular parts of your feet give you problems, a thermo liner may be the solution. You can get your thermo liners customised in many Blue Tomato shops; with some liners, you can even do it yourself in the oven at home. There are liners, especially for the park, with integrated cushioning that dampens hard landings. Sole Cushioning Boots have cushioning so you can survive hard landings without bruising your heels. Essentially, there are four types of cushioning: EVA , an especially light and flexible plastic that is often used for cushioning. However, it loses its shape with excessive cold, and therefore diminishes in quality. PU is a strong and durable plastic that does not lose its properties, even in icy temperatures, but costs more than EVA. Air cushioning in the sole absorbs high impacts. This works especially well on the heel and forefoot areas, but less with icy temperatures. Gel pads are usually incorporated around the heel and work in the same way as air cushions, but are less susceptible to different temperatures. Don't forget the socks Even the perfect soft boot cannot realise its potential when you do not wear the right socks. Functional socks, which are long with reinforcements at critical points, maximise the fit of your shoe. Normal socks are too thin, can chafe at critical points and, in the worst case, slide down, wrinkle and provide unnecessary pressure points that can become really painful. An adjustment of the liner by the use of special fans and sometimes even ovens is possible and advisable for most models in the middle and upper price segment. You can find information about this in the product descriptions or on the boot itself.

The first number is degrees incline/decline (measured by using your transit), and the second is the actual value. Multiply that by the distance to some distant point, and the result is an approximate elevation change. Or divide an elevation change by the sine value to determine distance. Extended mathematical answer: Imagine you're at the bottom left corner of the triangle below. Looking at a summit that's 35 degrees up, the sine lookup would be 0.574. If you determine that the distance is 4 miles away (either by walking it, or guessing), you get 4 * 0.57 = 2.8 miles elevation gain from the original reference point. This also works the other way around if you know the relative elevation change of a point from your current position. In the example, if you know the summit is at 35 degrees and is 2.8 mi above you, divide 2.8 / 0.57 = 4.9 miles would be the length of the shortest route to the top.",quick reference tables for sines in trigonometry,0.165861115,8,56,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14730

Leave no trace , don't spoil it for everyone else, if hoards of people start appearing in the mountain areas leaving rubbish everywhere, it's going to get clamped down on and you'll ruin it for everyone, take everything out with you! Be discreet, don't camp in the middle of a busy footpath at 1pm (though I have seen this done and no one really complained). Find a quiet remote area, pitch late and leave early (you'll enjoy it more anyway) Keep away from roads. You don't want your camp site to be visible from the road. This will likely result in a knock on your tent from the police or the local landowner who will move you on. Ideally you want to walk about 1/2 an hour away from the nearest road to be safe. So back to your question, there are quite a few ""wild"" areas in the south east. One that particuarly springs to mind is the chilton hills . That said, nowhere is particuarly remote (I don't know the area well so I may be corrected here) your always going to be near a road or something. It's simply too populated.

14825,,What is the most efficient strategy to melt snow using a stove?,wind shield,"For maximum efficiency (i.e. melted water per used fuel) make sure the following things are always true: Always have some water in the pot. Never have only water in the pot. Having water increases the thermal conductivity between the pot and the snow/water. With just snow you have a smaller contact area. As long as there is both snow and water in the pot, the temperature stays at the lowest possible (i.e. melting temperature in the prevailing conditions). All energy goes into melting snow. When there is only water, energy will go into raising the temperature of the water. This means it is best to remove water and add snow in regular intervals. Edit regarding having/opening a lid: As pointed out by Paparazzi the benefits from having a lid when melting snow is probably negligible. At melting temperature water will hardly evaporate at all (the vapor pressure is at only 0.006atm at 0degC while it is at 1atm when boiling). Unrelated to handling snow/water but still very relevant: Only based on experience the most important factor for efficiency is something else: Heat exchange between the flames and the pot itself. That is why devices like Jetboil (heat directed around a pot with ""heat exchanger"") are very fast at boiling water (usually at the expense of weigth to size ratio). For any burner this means use a wind shield. Preferably one that is as high as the pot and with just a bit bigger diameter than the pot.

15411,,What role does information about atmospheric pressure play from an outdoor perspective?,let you know your depth,"From a scuba diving / apnea (free) diving perspective knowing your barometric pressure can let you know your depth - At 1 bar you are at surface level, with each 10m descent you are at a further 1bar. So at 10m you're at 2bar. At 15m you're at 2.5 Bar etc. There are many risks with being underwater from a scuba perspective which increase with depth. From as little a depth as 5m you can become (depending on you as an individual) susceptible to the effects of nitrogen - as you breathe in and out under water your body takes in more nitrogen than you do at the surface, this again varies on you as an individual (fat absorbs more nitrogen etc). Apnea divers tend to not be affected as they hold a continuous breath. Nitrogen narcosis can cause a lot of problems, from becoming incredibly slow in responding to hallucinating. Also with scuba you must continue to breathe, holding your breath can lead to a lot of issues. With depth, and therefore pressure increases, your lungs volume changes, so if you imagine a balloon full of air at the surface, at 40m the balloon will be 1/4 the size but hold the same amount of air. Now imagine you fill that balloon further whilst under water, and then coming up - the balloon will burst as the air expands coming up. This is exactly why divers can never hold their breath, and why you may get a poke in the stomach from your buddy if they don't see bubbles.

16703,,What are the easiest trekking routes in Sarek National Park in Sweden?,to take the routes that many people take,"The easiest is to take the routes that many people take, because on those routes, social trails have formed and you may find help if you are in trouble. 5‚Äì7 days is too short. Although you can get through quickly if you take take the route from Tj√•motis into Aktse and you might make it to Akkastugorna in 5 days, I would not recommend it. You should take extra days in case of delays, and if you are not late, you can use those extra days for detours or day trips. However, if you mean you have 7 days to get from Aktse to Kisuris (for example), you should be OK. Kungsleden (the mountain ""highway"" full of cabins and trails so well maintained they remind of North American National Parks) leads through the far southeastern corner of the park, from Saltoluokta via Aktse to Kvikkjokk. At Aktse, you can take a boat to a point under Namm√°sj. From here, there is a reasonably good trail all the way to Skarja and Kutjaure at the tri-park-point with Stora Sj√∂fallet and Padjelanta. Although this trail is not an official trail and contains some laborious stretches, in particular through Rapaselet, it is nowhere difficult by Sarek standards, and at times actually has wooden planks laid out through wet areas. However, you will still need a tent and you will still need to ford streams. There are no navigational challenges. This route is popular and if you hike it in summer, you will meet plenty of other people, probably several groups every day. That makes it easier as well, because you will not need to bring equipment such as a satellite phone: in summer on the trail you are certain to meet other people who may be of assistance in case of an emergency (by warning authorities as soon as they reach civilisation). However, I recommend autumn as the birch forest may be full of mosquitoes in summer. I hiked this route in September 2013, and it's very, very beautiful, in particular the view from Skierffe above Aktse. We met people three times in total. If you do one thing in Sarek, hike to Skierffe ‚Äî you can do it as a day trip from Aktse. You can also hike from Skierffe down to Rapadalen (we did this in 2013) but that requires more off-trail navigation including through the woods. If you seriously only have 5‚Äì7 days, you won't make it far into Sarek. Use Aktse as a base and hike into the park 1‚Äì2 days, then turn around to where you came from. You won't have time to cross Sarek through Aktse if you start at Kvikkjokk or Saltoluokta. View from Skierffe toward Laitaure, 11 September 2013 View from Skierffe toward N√°mmasj.

All the other trees had dropped their leaves, but the magnolia doesn't shed its thick leaves seasonally, it sheds them like an evergreen throughout the year. It was odd to see a green-leafed tree in the dead of winter. Trees up north shed their leaves in order to preserve water, as 90% percent of the water trees soak up evaporates into the air, so if they kept their leaves through the winter they'd die from thirst. The magnolia seems to be able to survive with its thicker leaves by curling them up in the winter. Your first impression is that the tree is curling up its leaves in an effort to stay warm, but I believe it's actually trying to conserve water by hiding its leaves from the sun.

Also the dynamic pressure of moving water could easily exceed the hydrostatic head of many fabrics. So I'd be very wary about using a large soft one for things that have to be completely dry. My first aid kit, for example, is in one small dry bag inside another which it shares with other emergency kit that can handle a little damp.

The reason for this is that not having any pad at all looses a lot of heat into the ground if you are camping on snow. Even the warmest bag will be uncomfortable without a pad camping on snow. While inflatable pads are really nice, they all eventually fail, particularly in the presence of crampons. You can survive the night with any of the standard selection of foam pads. A good inflatable pad plus foam pad will extend the range of your sleeping bag and provide comfort vs survival. In my experience people underestimate how much heat gets lost into the ground. The other advantage of having a foam pad is that you can use it quickly during the day during rest stops. Being able to sit without losing heat makes a big difference as the day goes on.

And while bolts will lead your way, you still get a feeling for lines which is one of the most important factors on alpine climbs. Climbing style Indoor climbing focuses a lot on holds and strength. Outdoor climbing is much more about feet and friction, also for holds. This is really a huge factor.

Here are the results I found and the dates, and I only quoted the ones that don't require typing out the passages by hand. 1983 1984 1984 1985 Nash argues for the designation of ""norescue wilderness"" areas in some parks, places where visitors understand that they're on their own. ""National park zones of self-reliance could be rated for visitor competency and should be accompanied by a program of wilderness licensing,"" he says, enlarging on the idea. ""Let those who wish to enter no-rescue wilderness prepare themselves for that privilege."" 1985 A discussion of the moral implications of a ""no-rescue"" wilderness area (rugged, remote, possibly dangerous areas featuring no trails, signs, patrols, or search-and-rescue) considers such aspects as lack of liability, right of choice by visitors, and conflicting perspectives on the subject. (CB) 1987 1987 A radical few are pushing for creation of ""no-rescue zones,"" where people would be on their own in the natural world--come hell or high water. ""We live in a society where people want to experience the benefits of high adventure but then force somebody else to pay the costs when things go wrong,"" said Leo McAvoy, a University of Minnesota professor who favors no-rescue zones. ""It's time for some self-responsibility."" 1993 1994 1994 1994 The lack of judgment and personal responsibility of wilderness travelers with the resultant cost of rescue has led to the proposal of no-rescue zones. Certain wilderness areas would be posted with advisories that travelers enter at their own risk; helicopters (and possibly search teams) would not enter. Given the current legal climate in the United States, this concept is unlikely to win support. 1995 Second, because of the high fee, the climbing community felt they were being singled out and attacked. They argued strongly for ideas like ""no rescue zones"" and personal bonding, and they attacked several aspects of the Service's mountaineering program. Some of the arguments were simply unrealistic. History has repeatedly shown that climbers in trouble will call for help, and if they don't families will call politicians who will demand that the Service respond. 1995 2005 No-rescue wilderness is an idea based on the preservation of the wilderness experiance Users are solely responsible for their own personal welfare. agencies that manage that area of land would be absolved of all legal risks involved agencies would infact be prohibited from intervening in no rescue areas for any reason! 2012 Attempting to rouse more pointed debate, Kennedy suggested, ‚ÄúI wonder if we shouldn‚Äôt have no-rescue zones.‚Äù That would be the extreme, libertarian response to Simonson‚Äôs ‚Äúbuyer beware‚Äù in a market that should only properly be selling, in Viesturs‚Äô phrase, ‚Äúa chance to try,‚Äù not the right to reach the summit. 2007 This Mount Hood story has a lot of folks demanding that reckless hikers and climbers who need rescuing be billed for the rescue, or even that certain zones be declared no-rescue zones; if you enter them, and something goes wrong, well, been nice knowing you. 2009 In addition to defraying the cost, the frequent rescues have spurred some interesting ideas from no-rescue zones to backcountry rescue insurance. While some ideas are intriguing, others border on the bizarre.

Eventually clouds develop, and precipitation wrings moisture from the air. At the summit, the air is now both warmer and drier than air of the same altitude that has not climbed the mountain. But as the air passes over the summit and flows down the other side of the mountain, it compresses and warms at 5.4¬∞F per 1,000 feet (now following the dry-air rate), creating a much warmer, dryer wind.

20799,,What is a reasonable budget to solo-hike the Continental Divide Trail?,350$ of trail food,"I did the CDT this year (5 months, 2700mi, NoBo). In this answer, I will focus on budget while on trail (not budget to buy gear or transport to get on trail). General advices (some answering to paparazzo advices): Food on trail I counted 10-12$/day for food. I was cold soaking and eating often the same meals (ramen, dried refried beans, tuna, nutella, skittles and other sweets). Lots of hikers (including me) eat mostly junk food, because it's the most convenient way to have your daily calories (easy to get, easy to prepare, cheap). Fire stove are a no go: it's very often forbidden due to forest fires (in my case, I would say it was forbidden 70% of the trail, and really frown upon for 15 other percents). If you want to eat healthy or varied, that will be way more expensive as you will have to prepare in advance and do mail drops. Mail drops might be required for some resupplies, but I would advise to wait to be on trail to send them, so that you can put what you really need in it. Here are the one you might want to consider as those 'towns' are not good to resupply (no store or store way too small): Doc Campbell's, NM Pie town, NM Ghost Ranch, NM Twin Lakes, CO (there is a general store good enough if you stay on junk food) South Pass city, WY Towns and lodging I slept in town at almost every resupply: shower, laundry, resupply, eating, good bed. Some people were only passing by. If you hike with other people (I started alone but met people on trail and was never alone in town), a night in town will be between 15-20$ and 40$ (depending on the size of your group and the location - Colorado is more expensive than Idaho). I shared room with between 2 to 5 other persons while on trail; the most I had to pay was 40$. Towns are great, but there are many ways to spend money there, like restaurant. Count between 10 et 15-20$ a meal, depending on what and where you eat. McDonald's are often cheap, and for 7$ you can leave with a full stomach and plenty to drink. You will want/have to take zeros days. I took 16, some took only 5, others took 25. You can share laundry with others hikers. Gear and gear replacement I used 4 pairs of shoes, 2 underpants. The new shoes were sent to me to Post Offices along the way. You can buy Darn Tough Socks: those are really good, and there is a life warranty. It's quite easy to find a store while on trail and replace them for free when they have holes. I replaced them 5 times (one time I had burnt one of them in a campfire, and it was still ok to replace it!). You might have to buy additional gear alog the way: better fleece if you're too cold, bear spray (not mandatory but really, really advised) while in grizzly country. I had to buy a new mattress as my air mattress was too worn out to wistand all the trip. Orientation and planification Guthook CDT is the reference for orientation and planning. 40$ the package for all 5 sections. There are plenty of alternates, some officials, other only on Ley's map or invented while on the field. The official length is 3014 miles as of 2018; the actual average length is about 2700mi. It can go as low as 2500mi if you take all the shortcuts. Don't plan to much in advance: plan for the first month, no more. After that your body and your needs will change greatly, so you will have to plan accordingly. Budget per month I would say, for one month: 350$ of trail food 200$ to sleep in town if you sleep there every time you resupply (5 nights at 30$ + 1 or 2 rest days) 250$ of town food (restaurants, beers) 60$ of miscellanous (mostly laundry, mailing boxes) 150$ of gear replacement (mostly shoes, but also other stuff broken or lost) So about 1000$/month on average. You can go with way less (like 5 or 600$) if you do it without any comfort (no overnight in town, no fancy food, etc.). That's the average amount advised for a thru-hike. It's the same than for the AT or the PCT, because even if the trail is different our needs will stay the same. It might be easier to reduce the costs on the CDT because less towns means less temptations. Reducing the costs I spent about 1000$/month (5000$ total) without concerning me about how much I was spending (I new I have enough), so my guess would be that's a good ""comfort"" budget. If I had had to reduced that amount, I would have spent less time in town (less overnights, less restaurants, and less beers). Don't try to go with cheap gear that you don't know, it could backfire. Nevertheless, some items can be cheap and still good and lightweight: my fleece was 10$. my rainjacket was 5$ (yes). Dri Ducks from Frogg Toggs is 20$ and very good for that price. Don't rush yourself to buy the best items in every category: go out, experiment, try some DIY if you can.

24248,,"What are the differences between prismatic, lensatic, mirrored, and optical sighting compasses?",they require a separate protractor to take bearings off of a map,"The typical protractor-style compass is an optical compass. To shoot an azimuth with it you align marks on the compass and read the bearing off the dial. The other varieties have a sighting wire which is placed over the target and a separate mechanism to help reading the bearing. The primary advantage is accuracy because the bearing can be read while observing the target; the primary drawback is that they require a separate protractor to take bearings off of a map. A lensatic compass has a lens and wire which can be unfolded. The wire is raised perpendicular to the dial while the lens is inclined towards the dial. With the compass held to your eye you align a notch on the lens holder, wire, and target much like iron sights on a rifle. Then by looking through the lens you can read the bearing off the dial. Because you don't need to move the compass to see the object and dial it's much more accurate than optical types. The prismatic compass is similarly constructed, with a prism rather than a lens. It functions much the same as a viewfinder in an SLR camera. You look through a hole at the target object and the prism reflects the dial into the bottom of your field of view. This eliminates the need for careful alignment of the lensatic style; you don't even need to move an eye to glance at the lens. For hiking and camping the type is completely irrelevant because the margin of error in dead reckoning grossly exceeds the error of any sighting compass. For precision work from a fixed position such as a surveyor's tripod or fire tower a prismatic compass is the natural choice because it's a few minutes more accurate than the lensatic. The military tends towards lensatic models because they're accurate enough to direct fire, cheap, and durable. Don't overlook the durability angle if you've already decided to forgo the integrated protractor/measurement of a baseplate compass. The military ones are housed in a steel clamshell which takes beatings much better than plastic models.

W3W can target a building entrance or location that doesn't have a street address fairly accurately. However, I think you are right to be sceptical. Pros Ease of remembering certain locations. Shorter values (three words to mark a 3mx3m square, which for most applications is more than adequate), as opposed to lengthy lat and long numbers. Particularly as longer words are reserved for squares that will be used less, such as over the ocean. Makes sharing locations over, for example, poor quality phone lines more reliable (possibly). Useful where street names aren‚Äôt really used or in areas where a single postcode can cover a large area. Cons The algorithm is closed source and whilst the developers promise not to game the system (such as sponsorship deals to change the words used to identify a corporate HQ to something relevant to that company - e.g. Ford's HQ being identified by cool.motor.cars ) a promise really isn't worth anything IMO. Licensing costs for car manufacturers etc to put the technology in their products. Doesn't work with altitude, although to be fair, neither does lat and long without adding a height vector. Current systems (GPS, lat/long, zip & post codes) are so ubiquitous that I can't see this system becoming universally adopted. It is non-hierarchical. That is; there is no connection between the words used in adjacent squares. Neither will only knowing two words of a square allow you to get a rough idea of its location such as knowing a town name, but not a street would. Can only be used electronically. You can't get your W3W location from a paper map, which should be an important backup option for anyone interested in the outdoors. Offline use is possible but needs to be planned for and downloaded in advance if in a poor signal area. No correspondence between different language versions.

Your other questions indicate you might be pretty new to climbing, and it is common for beginners to make this mistake. Primarily, you should be climbing with your legs - pushing your weight up. Legs are used to your weight - arms, and fingertips, are not. If you are steady on your legs - especially if you are able to get your leg straight so you are standing through bone and not relying on a bent knee - then you should only need to use your hands for balancing yourself. Obviously, there are times when you really do need to grip harder, and even pull yourself up rather than push, but climbing is as much a thinking game as it is physical, and planning your moves goes a long way to preventing fatigue and injury. Treating joint pain - ice packs probably help.

344,,What is the best material to make an outdoor shelter roof out of?,loft,"The same way that modern houses aren't made out of only one material (in most places), your shelter should be made up of different materials as well. Obviously this all depends on where you are and what is available. Primarily you'll need two types of materials. (I'll assume you're in a fairly standard deciduous forest): Structure: You'll want to use sturdy, thick wood to build the structure of your shelter. You're going to be piling on a significant amount of loft and protection, and you don't want the whole thing collapsing on you in your sleep. I think the general recommendation here is to find a large branch or log around 10 feet long, and prop it up in the fork of a tree. You'll then prop up smaller branches or large sticks along both sides of that main branch to create a wedge-shaped frame for your structure, as seen in the first image below : Insulation & Protection: The next step is adding loft to help insulate your shelter and offer basic wind and rain protection. Basically, just grab arm-fulls of the small sticks, leaves and other debris that are all over the forest floor and pile them on your structure. It can be tricky to get them to stay on top without sliding off the side or falling between the branches, so start around the base and build your way up. Patience is a key part of this. Trash bags can be useful for this, if you have them. Depending on how cold it is and what the conditions are like, you should try to have 2-3 feet of loft covering your structure, as seen in the second image, above. You want it to be thick, but matted down so that it doesn't all blow away while you're sleeping. 2-3 feet of loft might sound like a lot, but you'll want as much as you can get to ensure you stay warm and dry.",loft,0.297337443,1468,1472,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/344

1207,,What is the effect of changing side and edge bevel on ski edges?,difficult to control,"No answers yet, so I'll put in my 2 cents. A more aggressive edge (3+ degrees) bevel will cut into ice better, improving turns, but making the skis more itchy (squirrel-y?). A less aggressive edge (0-1 degree) won't bite as easily, but wears down slower and is more comfortable to ride for beginners. The base bevel and side bevel can both be changed, but typically you only sharpen from the sides once everything is set. There are two ways to apply this angle change. One is by eye, using a file. This method isn't very reliable for a consistent angle, but unless you're skiing really hard you probably will do just fine. You can wrap a little tape around your file to tilt it upwards a hair as a simple guide. The next method is using a fixed bevel tool or a multi-angle tool. Ski shops use the fixed ones because they are the most reliable and consistent, but they are also more expensive (for reference, see this bevel tool , which costs $20, and you only have one bevel option). These tools typically accept either a diamond stone or regular file. Don't forget to de-tune the first few inches of your skis when you're done! To ""de-tune,"" you run a file at a perfect tangent to the edge (you are making it slightly dull, taming that beautiful sharp edge you just made) for the first few inches of the ski's edge (beginning around the point where it will actually contact the snow). You do this because a very sharp tip or tail edge can cause your skis to be difficult to control. Imagine catching a sharp edge that far from the controlling force of your foot - not fun. There are several good websites that provide more detail and specifics, including Tognar Toolworks , which has a detailed write-up.

1239,,What sleeping bags are needed for a northbound thru-hike of the AT,garbage bag,"It somewhat depends on how warm you sleep and how much you're willing to layer up in your bag. I've met people who claim they used one 30F bag the whole trip (with thick layers at the start, and used as a quilt through the rest of the trip). I would call them ""ultralight freaks"". The more normal setup is to start with a 0-20F bag, depending on your normal warmth level, then transition to a 30-45F bag/quilt once the weather turns (and send home the extra layers). I've only met a few people who used synthetic bags on thru-hikes, and they were all quilt users, so assuming you go for down, I would aim for these companies (in this order): Western Mountaineering or Feathered Friends, Montbell, Marmot (only 800+ fill, the rest of their bags aren't so good), Mountain Hardware. There are a bunch more of course, but when you're going to spend 130-150 days in a sleeping bag, it's worth getting one that will still be lofty at the end of your trip, and for that you have to shell out for good down fill. If you're more interested in quilts, Jacks R Better, or Nunatak if you are literally made of money.

1720,,What types of kayaks are suitable for occasional class 1 and 2 rapids,whitewater or completely flat-bottomed rec kayak,"I understand your goal in asking this question, but I think you're approaching it wrong: you should choose a kayak based on your skill and expected use. Each type of kayak will have benefits and drawbacks in each type of water, and some are completely unsuited for it -- choose one that fits your uses best. A well-known example: a recreational kayak is the wrong choice for kayaking on the ocean. Class 1 and 2 rapids are fantastic. I think it's probably fair to say that anybody with no skill and the right boat can make it through class 1 rapids with no concern. I think class 2 rapids should probably be handled by somebody with at least a little experience on the water, and the less experienced should always be accompanied by somebody more experienced. So, I am confident that you could do some class 1 rapids with any of those types of kayaks. For class two rapids, I would first be concerned with your skill level -- both on the water in general, and with the type of kayak being used (and maybe even the specific model). While class two rapids may not require much maneuvering, spinning a 20' sea/touring kayak is going to be practically impossible and therefore impractical; a 14-16' sea kayak is probably manageable for any experienced paddler. A whitewater or completely flat-bottomed rec kayak provide the maneuverability required, however a less experienced paddler will find themselves spinning with each stroke and out of control -- and therefore perhaps in a dangerous situation. In my opinion, the right choice for a new paddler is a rec kayak. They're fun, easy to use, and relatively cheap to buy/rent. Getting some experience with an eye towards determining what you ultimately want to do will help you make an informed decision. Rent a few times and take a lesson or two and you'll have gained a huge amount of experience to help you know what kind of kayak you really want and will lead you to the best choice. Experience is king. An experienced paddler will be able to take anything through class 1 or 2 rapids, no doubt. An inexperienced paddler could end up in a dangerous situation. I think it's essential to start out on calm flat water to learn strokes, practice technique, and gain some confidence. On that flat water you can learn to maneuver the kayak around strainers, rocks, or buoys. You can learn how a sweep differs from a front stroke, and what you can make the kayak do with each of those. Also on flat water, try working in windy conditions -- it'll do a surprisingly good job of mimicking how a river and rapids can push your boat around and teach you how to handle it. Once confident, go out on a slow river to put your skills to the test. Eventually move up to some faster moving water, and throw in a class 1 rapid. Try a short class 2 next. Then if you can find it, go through a long class 2 -- you'll get splashed quite a bit and get a solid workout. After working through class 2 you might want to step up to class 3. While gaining all of this experience you're going to learn how a kayak handles and what it does well and poorly, and more importantly you're going to see how your skill grows with it. As you do this stuff you'll be able to recognize where each type of boat is the right choice. Trying to more directly answer your question: IMO, a whitewater kayak is only useful for whitewater/surfing waves. A sit on top is good for jumping in and out of the water. A rec kayak is a good choice for many. A short touring/sea kayak is a good choice for many. A long touring/sea kayak is the right choice for racers and travelers.",whitewater or completely flat-bottomed rec kayak,0.045007698,1259,1307,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1720

3220,,What exercises should you do before a ski trip to build leg stamina?,"Crunches, sit-ups, side presses","Skiing is a full-body, high endurance, activity. Being in good cardio-vascular shape is important, and can be achieved through running, swimming, rowing, etc... This can not be over-emphasized. Get your heart in shape. Assuming you already are in decent shape, here are some exercises that will help you get through those initial days on the hill. I've chosen exercises that require no additional weight -- your body and gravity provide all the resistance you need. (Some can be enhanced by holding light weights if so desired.) --Leg Strengthening-- Wall squats: Sit with your back against a wall, your feet together on the ground, and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold for increasing amounts of time. As strength increases, raise one leg at a time horizontal out in front of you. Repeating multiple reps of 30 seconds to a minute. Feel the burn. Lunges: Take a large step, dropping your back knee to the ground while bending your front knee (try to keep the front knee at a 90 degree angle). Return to standing, repeat for other leg forward. Do 50 steps or more. One legged speed squats: Stand with 90% weight on one leg, and 10% on the other. Squat down and stand up as rapidly as you feel comfortable for 20-40 reps. Repeat other side. Plyometrics: If you are already in good general shape, plyometrics will amp up your legs into bomber ski shape**. Simple moves like: jump-squats: lower into a squatting position, feet shoulder width apart, then explode up through standing and jump. Return to squat position. standing three-direction jumps: stand upright, feet together. Jump up, twisting your lower body so your feet now point to the right, but shoulders point forward. Jump back to center, then left. Right -Center -Left -Center -Right. Imagine the snow-flocked pine trees whipping by your face. High knee jumps (Jump knee-tucks): Stand upright. Keeping your torso at the same height, jump your knees up toward your chest repeatedly. (Legs come up, body stays the same). --Core strength-- Your core is also super-important. Skiing (done right) requires a lot of twisting (shoulders stay pointing downhill while your lower body carves back and forth.) Crunches, sit-ups, side presses , etc are all super-helpful and common exercises, so I won't explain them. A new one I've added to my repetoire (thanks P90X!) is ""Mason Twists"" aka Russian Twists: Sit with your back straight and your legs elevated in front of you so your body makes a V feet at chest level. Clasp your hands. Rotate your torso, and hit the ground on the left side with both hands. Rotate your torso to hit the ground on the right side with both hands. Go back and forth, side-to-side for 40-50 reps in rapid succession. --Balance and static strength-- Skiing is a balance sport. Knowing how your body moves, how it is centered, and how your body responds is important. Consider various yoga moves: Warrior 1,2 and 3: I won't try to describe them here, since they are easy to do wrong. I recommend seeking a yoga class in your area. But the warriors are GREAT for strengthening your knees (common ski injury areas) and learning balance. Tree Pose: The ultimate balance posture. In its simplest form, stand with good posture on one leg for as long as you can. A regular yoga practice will help in all areas of fitness. * *NOTE: Higher-impact exercises like plyometrics can cause injury if done improperly. Land softly when you jump.

It doesn't burn but does eventually degrade when exposed to the high heat of a stove. A simple replacement wick could potentially be fashioned out of nearly any fiberglass insulation such as that used in home construction. Furnace filters are often made of fiberglass filter media. It is also often used (usually bonded with other materials) as thermal insulation in automobiles to isolate the engine and exhaust heat from the cabin of the vehicle. If used from one of these type of sources, make sure the fiberglass itself is free of any other combustible materials or glues. These are simply a few applications where fiberglass insulation is used as it has become quite a ubiquitous material. Another possible source is the wick from a lantern. Even with different fuel types, most lanterns I've ever seen use fiberglass for the wick. However there are so many lantern types and brands out there that you'd need to research the exact type for yourself. But the main thing is to make sure that it's made of fiberglass or other fire-retardant material. This page has some good information on wick material.

A beginners mistake is to locate the next good hole, then place whatever foot's most convenient (usually not the one you moved last) without thinking about how to carry on from there, leading to an inelegant ""hop"" as you switch feet on a little hold so you have the right one free to carry on. Another tip from a friend: think about which foot you would like free when you're in a particular hold, not which foot is easiest to place there.

6725,,"What is the name of this knot for tying into a ""confidence"" rope?",double overhand knot,"The knot in the photo you posted is a double overhand knot. It's often used as half of a double fisherman's bend, and that's essentially how it's being used in the web page. (It will become a double fisherman's bend once the loop of cord is weighted and the two knots collide.) The web page advocates using this as a harness to tie in someone who doesn't have a manufactured harness. This is not the procedure I've seen recommended for this. One problem is that once you weight the loop, you have a double fisherman's knot, which is extremely difficult to untie. Another problem is that the single strand of rope is likely to hurt the person wearing it if they take a fall. The more standard, safe procedure in this situation would be to use a bowline on a coil. I believe that's what people did before swami harnesses and seat harnesses. However, it's not the best thing if someone's going to take a hard fall; it can injure or asphyxiate them.

But, this technique that I am going to explain is NOT necessarily the best one to implement under extreme circumstances. Things you need: Ideally a wire or a Strong thread and/or shoelace, preferably a nylon thread of you have. Some rabbit bait A knife for fine craft work Hunting is a skill that involves fine craftsmanship, understanding the surroundings and the mentality and habits of animals. Look for the places where you are most likely to find rabbits. You should be looking for their droppings, tracks, rubs, scratches, signs of feeding, shelter or burrow entrances, food and water sources, etc. Select a place suitable for setting up the trap like the one I have drawn in the picture. ( Kindly neglect my bad work with the Paint tool ) Pick a tree or something similar that can give the kind of a recoil action when the latch is disturbed, so that the loop shall swing in the opposite direction and above the ground (+ a rabbit's height). Fix a base deep in the ground. Make a notch on it to latch the trigger in it as shown. Craft a trigger which can be latched into the base as shown. This may take some time. Tie a string (you can use a shoelace) to the tip of the small plant. The plant should be tough enough to bear the weight of a rabbit. Make a loop of wire and tie it to the trigger part. Practice the loop part multiple times as this simple knot is too crucial to fail. You may have to put some obstacles around the set up so that the animal is forced to be diverted towards the setup. Finally put the bait in front of the setup such that the rabbit will have to pass through the loop. So that when he necks though the loop and move ahead, the latch is popped, the trigger is lifted and the rabbit is hung. This set up may fail in case of strong winds and other physical disturbances. make sure the you don't put one such set up on a cattle trail as that would injure the cattle. Lastly, a humble request, on a personal note, though hunting is legal in many parts of the world, try not to hunt for no reason and just for fun, be humane with your hunting techniques. Don't trap an animal for fun and in a manner that it would torture them physically. God forbid, but, if you at all are really into a situation where hunting is the last resort for survival, make sure that you kill them quick, after-all its a life that you are taking, don't make it slow and painful.",Tie a string (you can use a shoelace,0.046133362,1339,1375,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7218

8142,,What do I do if a black bear is right outside my tent?,shoot it,"I've been up close with grizzly and black bears before, I've had them come sniffing through my camp and I've done nothing but lay quiet in my sleeping bag and wait for them to wander off, which they usually do. Most of the time I don't even know they were there, I just find their tracks the next morning. Believe it or not bears spook really easily. I've never had to use bear spray or shoot at a bear, they always run off as soon as we let them know we're getting close. So if you're in your tent and a bear is taking his time investigating your site, all you have to do most of the time is just announce yourself and that should be enough to scare them away. The human voice is the number one deterrent for bears , so just start making loud noises. This will work most of the time, but the real problem bears are the ones that are used to humans, especially the ones that have been fed by humans in the past or found food in camps before, if one of these bears wanders into you site and doesn't act like it intends to leave without first finding something to eat, then get your bear spray out, get out of the tent, act big and keep shouting. You need to be pretty close for bear spray to be effective (30ft/9m or closer) so only spray it if your other attempts don't work and the bear is approaching you, or letting you approach him. Do NOT spray it inside of your tent, you will immediately regret it and possibly do yourself some serious harm. Try to get upwind of the bear if possible, and aim for his nose. One good blast and that bear should take off real quick. Most people only cary one or the other, bear spray or a gun. A warning shot from a gun does just as good as bear spray does. People around here (Canadian Rockies) that hike with shotguns load it with 3 different types of ammo; the first round is just bird shot, to shoot in the air as a warning shot; the second shot is a slug, to shoot past the bear so he can hear the ball whistling past him; the rest of your rounds are all hollow-point bear stoppers, to put the beast down, because if the first two shots don't scare him away then nothing else is going to stop him. Hunters have bigger problems with bears than campers do, because hunters typically have a fresh kill with them that the bear wants (usually grizzly bears), with campers and hikers, it's usually a case of the hikers sneaking up on the bear unintentionally and surprising it-in which case the bear acts defensively- or bears happening upon a campsite because it's on the side of a trail (bears use trails too) and finding food there. Shotguns are only necessary if the bear charges, tries to get into your tent, or is following you and you can't shake them off your trial. This is especially true with black bears, if a black bear is following you, and isn't scared off by any of your attempts to get him to leave, then odds are good you're going to have to either fight it off or shoot it, because there have been incidents where black bears have been known to stalk people for food. These incidents are very rare, and will typically only occur in the most wild areas where bears don't have much contact with humans. ... suppose a bear finds my tent and likes the smell of warm man-flesh inside of it. Coming from bear country, if shouting at it doesn't scare it away and you have a gun, ten out of ten people where I'm from would say shoot it . Right through the tent. Don't even feel guilty about it, because if you don't shoot it, then a ranger probably will as soon as you report the encounter (assuming you managed to scare it off some other way). They don't tolerate bears that behave that way because they're a risk to people's safety. You've probably heard the saying, ""A fed bear is a dead bear."" They say that because 99% of the time, bears that get hand outs or find human food end up getting put down because they always come back for more. If you have a bear trying to get in your tent, and you don't have a gun: FIGHT IT . You are literally fighting for your life, so kick, scream, hit it in the face with anything you've got. Bear spray will only work if there's nothing in between you and the bear, so try to get out of your tent before trying to spray it, or like I said already, you can actually make things worse for yourself if you spray it inside of your tent. For Reference: To put it in perspective, deaths from black bear attacks in North America are about as common as shark attacks , and in many of the fatal encounters with black bears, the bear had fed on the victim.",shoot it,0.0569745,2920,2928,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8142

8722,,What are the best practices to ensure survival of catch and release fish?,"reel them in normal, but pick them out of the water with a net","In certain BC rivers, fishing is catch and release only, it's illegal to fish with anything but a single barbless hook. I have a whole tackle box full of spoons that have been hacked to death by a pair of side cutters in order to make them legal for catch and release. When you hook a fish, reel them in normal, but pick them out of the water with a net, don't just fling them onto the dirty shore where they can flop around in the sand and dirt and bash their bodies against the rocks. Grab them gently behind the gills to take the hook out, take a picture if you want one, then submerge them back in the water, head facing away from you, and gently ""wave"" them back and forth to get some water flowing through their gills. Reeling them in tires them out, so you need to give them a chance to recover before letting them go, don't just toss them back in the water, there might be a chance that they'll just float there and drown. Let them regain some strength and when they're ready they'll simply swim out of your hands and back down into the depths. The fish will mostly be ok, in fact it'll likely go right back to what it was doing before it got caught: looking for food. It's not unusual to catch the same fish over and over again while fishing catch and release. I sometimes wonder if they get used to being caught, and know they're going to be released so they just bite everything, not worrying about whether or not it might be a hook because they know they're going to be tossed right back in the water even if it is.","reel them in normal, but pick them out of the water with a net",0.036242988,291,353,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8722

Unlike a Lolotte (drop knee), the less aggressive backstep typically exploits footholds below knee level.

For example, if my right hip is against the wall, and I extend my right foot forward to place it on a hold, I would simply refer to it as using the ""outside edge"". But if I moved my right foot backwards to reach a hold, I would consider it a backstep.

As soon as your belayer reaches the rope's middle mark, he should double check that there's a stopper knot at the end.

Essentially, the prusik short-circuits the top bolt in the event that it fails, lowering the chance of hitting the ground. The only time you'll be on one bolt is right after cleaning the bottom bolt, at which point you should continue down-climbing to safety. In this situation, you would only leave a single carabiner or quick link, and in your scenario, you would use your (nylon) sling and locker for your prusik.

10946,,What Navigation Aids can I make on an island with only a knife?,sight reduction tables,"First things first you aren't going to be able to get longitude without an accurate clock and/or a tome of sight reduction tables . Without those aids which you'd be hard pressed to create while marooned on an island your navigational options are limited. The best you can really hope for is to follow a latitude line/plane. I think a cross staff would be an effective celestial navigational aid that could be improvised and allow you to follow a latitude line. Normally the shorter cross piece would slide up and down the length of the staff to allow you to measure angles. That is going to be too hard to calibrate, unless you know the angles between enough stars to calibrate it yourself. If you can calibrate the cross staff then you can pick the latitude you want, sail to that plane and turn east or west to follow it. If you can't calibrate it you need to sit on your boat at night and adjust (whittle) the length of the shorter cross piece so it lines up with the North star or the Southern Cross and the horizon. Once this is accomplished then you can maintain your current latitude by repeating the sighting and correcting as needed. Another option for latitude based navigation would be a Sun Compass. Of course the Achilles heel of this device is the sun's height varies increasingly as you move away from the equator. The proper name for this pattern is an analemma. Due to this variance you need to be lucky and be close to the equator and make corrections with your cross staff as needed.

13265,,What is the minimum caliber of handgun that would stop a grizzly bear?,.44 Magnum,"Bryce Towsley has this story to tell us about a grizzly attack: Shortly before I arrived in one northern Alaska camp, a couple of packers were rushing to beat the failing light. Covered with blood and loaded down with packs of caribou meat that doubled the weight pressing on their boots, they were tired and thinking mostly about a hot meal and a dry sleeping bag as they pressed toward camp. As the lead guy pushed through the thick brush along the river a very large grizzly bear stood up and took a swing at his head. Young reflexes saved him, as he ducked and the bear hit the pack, knocking him down. He rolled, drew the .44 Magnum pistol in his chest holster and emptied it into the bear, ending the encounter. Bryce Towsley goes on to say this about handguns and bears in his article Packing Pistols In Bear Country . The .44 Magnum is probably the bottom limit. I know, some guys claim the .41 Magnum or even the .357 Magnum is fine, but I do not agree. I have watched them both work on black bears and I was never impressed. The point here is not to prove you can stop a charging bear with a smaller, inadequate cartridge. The point is to survive. So, I think a .44 Magnum is the starting point. It is also important to use a heavy bullet. The key is to penetrate through bone and through a lot of critter, and for that you need bullet weight: at least 300 grains for a .44 Magnum and that much or more for any of the .454 Casull or heavy .45 Colt loads. I use 400-grain bullets in my .500 Wyoming Express; with some bigger cartridges like the .500 S&W Magnum you can go up as high as 500 grains. Part of the bullet-weight decision, though, should be based on your ability to shoot the cartridge. A 500-grain bullet at 1450 fps from a handgun is not a load most NPR listeners will want to shoot. I have passed my personal limits with some of the biggest cartridges when used in lightweight, carry-style handguns. For example, in my .500 Wyoming Express I had to back off from the full-power loads. A 400-grain bullet at 1600 fps proved too much for me (and everybody else who shot it) to handle well in a relatively light, 2-pound, 12-ounce Freedom Arms revolver. So I backed it down to about 1300 fps and found the load much more manageable, but still plenty bear-worthy. Cartridge selection? Well, I really believe any handgun you bring to any fight should have a name that starts with at least a 4. That‚Äôs really important if you are fighting a bear! I think the rule of ‚Äú4-3-1‚Äù should apply: a bullet diameter that starts with at least a 4, a bullet weight that starts with at least a 3 and a muzzle velocity of at least 1000 fps.

13574,,What might cause a massive blood stream from a lethally hit moose's mouth?,a heart shot,"A normally lethal shot with a bow hits both lungs and possibly the heart. This shot was interesting because the arrow didn't go very far in and probably only hit one lung. I haven't hunted moose, but have shot elk, and most of my shots go completely through the animal. Sometimes a bone gets in the way and if you watch the arrow in the video right after it impacts, there is still a good deal of shaft left exposed and the nock end seems to immediately get levered to the front of the moose. This is probably because the shot entered just behind the leg/shoulder structure. As the leg levered the arrow around, the broadhead that is inside the animal should cut a huge swath of tissue causing a good amount of bleeding inside the lung. The shallow hit on an animal that size probably means a bone strike and it didn't get both lungs, but the one lung that is hit was cut open internally. Lung shots do two things to the animal, the first is that the blood loss from the wound can be significant because of the amount of blood that flows through the lungs. The other effect is immobilizing the lungs and making them stop oxygenating the blood by filling the lung cavity with blood or with air that leaks out of the lung hole (called a tension pnuemothorax). The elk I have seen that have been lung shot wind-down just like this one did in the video. If you are tracking a wounded deer/elk/moose and suspect this type of wound and dying pattern, you can get tricked by the track they make because as they die, they get weaker and possibly dizzy. If you start to track them up a hill and the track suddenly dies, backtrack downhill or through the path of least resistance and you will often find your animal. You will often see pinkish tissue in the blood trail at some point where bits of the shredded lung are blown out through the mouth, and this lets you know you probably had a good lung shot. On the other hand, a heart shot will stop the blood pumping fairly quickly and there will be less blood to track, but shorter trail to follow. The first elk I ever shot I punched right through the shoulder blade and had a somewhat shallow strike. I watched the elk run off with the arrow flagging just like the one in the video here. The elk ran up a hill a few yards and just fell down stone dead. When I opened the chest cavity, the moving broadhead had severed the aorta right off the heart and made for a very quick death and no tracking required.",a heart shot,0.243041128,1916,1928,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13574

This means at least a base-layer, puffy, sleeping socks and hat that I keep dry during the day. With a wet bag I'd wear these under my walking clothing and rainwear. I wouldn't be comfortable, but at least I'd make it out. With a wet bag, consider getting back on the trail I always carry a decent walking torch and lightweight spare, and in almost all circumstances I'd probably prefer to get on the move if my bag was unusable - I'm going to be warmer and psychologically I'd find it less miserable to be doing something rather than shivering in the dark. Otherwise, you're in survival mode! If hitting the trail was impossible for some reason, you're in survival mode. Eat some fat, such as cheese, butter or oil. This gives your body the fuel to warm you up. Whenever you feel chilled get up and do some vigorous exercise such as star-jumps. If your shelter is intact the approach you took of wearing your rain-gear inside the bag is probably the best option. If your shelter is shredded you're reduced to looking for shelter from the wind and improvising with whatever fabric you could salvage. If it's legal and practical you could also consider building a fire, though this takes some skill in the rain.",building a fire,0.167818502,1974,1989,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13772

15002,,What materials can be used to make cordage in forests of the Adirondacks?,large bundles of grass,"tl;dr Gather a few plants from your area. For each one, flip a coin; if it's tails, you can use it for what you describe. Where I'm coming from on this I live near the area you specify; in New York, not in the Adirondacks but to the west of them, and I have been there. Fortunately though, my advice is generic. I have just recently gotten deeper into the cord/rope making craft, and I have been pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to make and how many resources will work. I have made a bunch of cords and ropes recently out of many different materials. The one part of your question that I cannot answer directly (but which I would say is not super important) is to be specific about species; I do not know what most of the plants around me are, but I just use them anyway, and most of them work! So here is my advice... The Good Part I have found that more plants seem to work than to not for this. Grasses, flowers, fibers, etc.. Anything that is soft and bendable is obviously a good first choice. Even if it is soft and breaks easily, that is usually fine if you just work in more of it. One extreme of the spectrum: mowed grass Even if it is short, that has not been a problem for me. Just a few days ago, I even decided to try it with short, mowed grass. I thought it would be difficult, maybe impossible, but I was surprised to find that even mowed grass, just 2 to 4 inches, made fine cord using the standard technique. I just started with a much smaller V to begin with the longest couple of grass blades I could find - I think those two blades were 4 or 5 inches - and I had to twist in extra material much more often than with longer resources. I made a cord that was a few millimeters thick, and it could have been used for some very lightweight purposes, and if made thicker it might have worked even for the table example you ask for. Obviously, un-mowed grass that is a few feet long will work much better than mowed grass. This was just to make a point. More plants will work if you soften them up first Many plants that are not fibrous and which seem too tough and non-pliable to use, I have found that I can still use them if I soften them up first. For some of the plants, I carefully squeeze the stem until it partially crushes, and some still hold together decent even if fully crushed. This allows them to bend some and to tie around objects, especially if the objects are large such that the plant needn't form a tight bend. Another softening technique Similar to the previous technique, I have found that some plants become quite workable if I do the following, assuming they do not simply snap into two pieces when I try this but instead stays together after breaking: I bend the plant carefully until it breaks (but does not come apart; it is still 1 length), and then I either try to repeat this making many breaks along the plant, or if the plant is not too stiff sometimes I can ""slide"" the break (not sure how else to describe it) along the plant so that it is thoroughly broken along the entire length - some plants still hold together well after doing this. Then it is workable enough to use as with other methods. Sometimes a processed cord is not necessary Also, some plants seem to be strong enough to use directly, without processing into nice cord or rope. I have found multiple plants which I can directly pluck and straight away tie into a circle and have a difficult time breaking them; they would work great for the situation you describe. Sometimes these plants, though working without being cord or rope, do still require processing like in the previous two techniques I mention. The default technique Of course, there is the technique I see most advertised: try to get strands of fiber from plants, often from inside the bark of woody plants (including trees) and twist them together. A tip on determination for the frustrated Just because I make the bold claim that most of the plants around me work for tying/lashing, that does not mean that it's all sugar and spice. What I do when I'm unsure of the resources in an area: I go for a short walk and take some time to look at all the different plants nearby, and I choose many of them that look promising and even some that do not look promising. I gather an armload of 5, or 10, or even more, different plant types - and often several plants of each type that I pick, sometimes it's more than an armload - and I sit down with them all and test each one. This can take a while. Sometimes I spend an hour just experimenting with what I gathered, and I find that these 2 plants work ok, this 1 barely works, those 2 work terrible, this 1 simply cannot work at all, and this one works great. Then based on the best candidates, I decide which one I will use: which one was most abundant? easiest to pick? did it make me itch or sting when I handled it? etc. Then I go gather. Depending on how far away the resource was or how plentiful or scarce it was: I will either gather several times more than I need to be safe (I still mess up and need to redo sometimes), or I gather just what I need and either go back for more if needed or sit and work at the resource's location. The clich√© phrase is very true here: if at first you don't succeed, try and try again. Do not be afraid to fail a lot. Just this morning I tried several new (to me) resources for making baskets, and I insisted on limiting myself to the materials a family member had on their 1-acre property, even when they suggested some proper basket-weaving plants ""just over their, off the property"". I tried several times, and I did not complete any of the baskets I started; one of the materials was sort of working and maybe I could have finished a basket with a lot of very slow, careful, hard work, but I decided it was not worth it and moved on to some different materials. This morning's basket making attempts were very enlightening for me, but I would consider the basket making itself to have been a failure - even if I did finish the one that was sort-of working it would have been a weak and flimsy basket. Another fun extreme: More grass What inspired me to get back into this skill and develop it more was reading a website about making ropes from grass. You can find the site that re-inspired me here. On that web page, a technique is discussed which uses multiple people and large bundles of grass to make large, strong ropes. The technique is based on the typical ""take a bit of your material, make a V, keep twisting in material into each side"" cordage technique, except it is scaled way up to a point where each person is doing what one or two of your fingers are doing when making the cordage by yourself. The ropes that guy makes, with groups of people, are said to be thick but strong, generally taking loads of hundreds of pounds. He claims that one rope they made could not be broken in a game of tug-of-war between a large group of adults. And this is grass . I am tempted now to include an entire section about some cultures which have (and still do in some cases) do neat things with grass ropes, such as the amazing bridges made out of grass ropes. But instead of delving into that, I will just mention it and suggest that Googling something like ""ancient grass bridges"" would provide interesting reading material. I would not want to trust a high bridge made of grass, but if done by skilled workers they do a fine job. Conclusion I used to have a hard time with this and considered paracord an integral part of my outdoor activities. But after experimenting with all of the plants I can find and practicing with them, I have found that it is actually difficult for me to go somewhere now and not find something that can be used for tying/lashing. Wherever I go, there seems to be multiple plants that fulfill the need. Even in the city, as long as it is a city with lawns, even fresh-mowed lawns provide adequate cord if you are determined enough - and I have done it from a city lot. Summary So, in essence, my answer is: The materials that work for your needs depends on your experience with them. Instead of researching which sources make the best cords or ropes, it is probably a better use of your time to learn how to make them from a larger range of sources. If you have practiced this, gather from 5 different plants (including trees) from the location you are in, and I would be surprised if you cannot find a suitable material for what you describe among what you have gathered. I cannot identify most of the stuff I use; I just use it and it just works. Disclaimer Of course, I have not traveled extensively far away. Perhaps my thoughts about this would be dashed if I left the U.S. north-east and went camping in the mid-west or in a different country. But thinking back to videos I have seen of situations in other countries, I am fairly confident of my previous statements. Of course, an area that does not have multiple or abundant plants, like a desert, is another story entirely, but I think my answer should work for most of the world, and it is catered to New York state as you requested. Also note: some of the materials may degrade quickly. I have never tested any of mine after a long time, but I have seen others say that their crude ropes (untreated, hastily constructed with poor weave or twist technique) has only lasted for months, or even days for some poor quality materials. I feel it important to add this so that you do not get the idea that all plants that work initially can be trusted to hold your large potting plant of garlic through the winter while you are away; when you come back in the spring that pot might be dumped on the ground. When I originally wrote this answer, I was envisioning something like ""I'm roughing it for a week or two and I want my own crudely built stuff while I'm here so it can be 'luxurious roughing it'.""",large bundles of grass,0.195470959,6348,6370,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15002

My guess is that August is about peak capacity for the huts since there are about 425 beds ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Huts_of_the_White_Mountains ). My guess is that the decreased numbers in June are due to less visitors at the beginning of the month due to black flies and schools still being in session and the decreased numbers in September are due to schools starting up again and it beginning to get cold.

The terrain is different from other types of waters you've traveled, but according to my friends who have done swamp canoeing, there are things that you can do, both before you go, and during your trip, which will make it easier and more fun. This advice is based on their travels, not my own, but I believe it's pertinent and hope it's helpful. Since you've picked your specific spot, check with local people who have navigated it before. Ask where the landmarks are, to help keep yourself oriented. Ask where the pitfalls are, such as areas of deeper drop off or a higher concentration of vegetation or other marine growth or rocks which might surprise you. If it's a well-documented area for swamp travel, look for a guidebook which you can study beforehand. If it will fit in your gear, take it with you. Take a smaller map too. If you know you'll have reliable GPS service, take the GPS with you. Program it beforehand, including stops at areas you may want to pull out along the way, either for safety or for sightseeing. Even if you have a GPS, take a compass. Check weather forecasts before you go. If fog or stormy weather arises, it will make it harder for you to see where you are, especially since swamps are generally dark and murky already. Even if you're experienced in canoeing in difficult weather, this type of situation is different, so you might want to choose a time where the forecast is for clear skies. When the sun shines down into the swamp, you can see even subtle changes in the terrain under the water, which are helpful. Time of day is easier to measure by sun also. If you're alone, let someone know where and when you'll be going. Check in with them when you get back, so they don't worry! Take a camera!

A large piece of ice is cut from a place where it isn't needed and moved to another place. This is done with for example chainsaws and axes. Usually the part right under a bridge is the last part to freeze and those spots are very weak. To transplant ice there means to put some more adequate ice there (at least 15 cm thick) so it can be skated on. If the water under the bridge already froze but isn't good enough/thick, it is removed first. In other places with for example a lot of wind, ice can be added to reduce water movement. This will make it freeze closed faster too. Of course you get the benefit of having the actual ice there but it also helps in getting the local temperature lower so natural ice forming is sped up. There is always only a small window where it is actually cold enough for having the Elfstedentocht or ice-skating significant lengths on natural ice in general, so boosting the natural freezing process by artificially reducing the temperature further helps. I am not exactly sure about its limits. Of course it is quite a massive operation so only suitable for relatively small parts. Once the ice is frozen re-attached to the existing ice, I don't imagine there is a large difference in quality though.",to put some more adequate ice there (at least 15 cm thick),0.034104936,316,374,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19458

On the con side, people might not realize right away that pink is as legal as orange, but they aren't going to mistake it for a deer for example.

19683,,What attributes should I look for in an inexpensive multi-purpose folding bike?,standard components,"BSO stands for Bicycle Shaped Object. Or department store bike. Bicycle people are not down on them for being cheap. They are down on them for low value. Even at $100 it is not a good value. Characteristics of a BSO is not just cheap parts but non standard parts. When they do break (which won't be long) it will be hard to replace the part. Some times they do not even honor standards. It might have a non-standard bottom bracket or head set. Also safety. BSO is just not as strong. If it fails you can get hurt. You have lot more leverage on a folding with long seat tube and handle bars to the frame. It takes more stress than a full size bike. Start with a bike that has standard parts and standard sizing of components. It can be the cheapest Shimano, SRAM ... groups. If components are not stamped with a known manufacturer then no. In bikes there a value point where the cost of ownership optimized. As you spend more initially the cost of maintenance goes down. Then you get to a point the components are for weight / speed and more expensive parts and the cost of maintenance goes up. In a regular bike where is that max value is debatable but some where around $600 - $800 retail. For me max value is to find a bike that was $1200 new and pick it up used for $400. I don't know as much about folding but that sweet spot will likely be more. Folding same thing look for standard components. Without a triangle folding bikes have more flex. Then on top of that hinged parts have flex. Internal gear hubs are more common for clearance. How compact is a factor. The more it folds the more opportunities for weak points. Speed of folding. With some assemble required it is typically a stronger set up for the same price range. Some fold side to side and some fold front to back. Fold back has less side to side flex but it is also more in the more expensive. Get on the bike and see how it fits. Flex it and look for play. If you can notice play in any of the hinges just flexing with your hand then no. Bromptom is one of major manufacturers and they start at $1200. I am sure there are some good value bikes less than that - just a data point. That said if you want a folding BSO go to Wallmart for $200 and see how long it lasts. On storage hang from the ceiling frees up floor space Another option is S & S couple. It is an add on the full frame lets the triangle be disassemble. If has all the pluses of a full size bike and the coupling is nearly as strong with no flex. They assemble in like 30 minutes and tools are required.

Can just loosen the handle bars and spin them or go all the way and remove the fork. A full size single speed mtn is going to out perform even a high end folding bike. More comfortable and reliable.

When using rope to support a hammock it is at an angle which greatly reduces load capacity (45 degrees is a 40% increase in load for example). When setting up for a hammock you are also going to have knots. Knots again will greatly reduce your load capacity (50+% easily). You are also moving up and down when you get in which increases the load on the line. I personally wouldn't hammock on anything rated below 1750lbs (so the 6mm would be fine). All the talk about weight aside, DON'T HAMMOCK ON PLAIN CORD because it is bad for the trees. You should be using webbing, or at least put something between the trees and the cord.",three,0.649302006,345,350,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22625
22741,,What to consider when choosing between rigid and inflatable stand up paddle boards?,lack of stiffness,"Great question I would think through in your specific case the following steps: store it (at home or at a public boat ramp if available) transport it (if it‚Äôs not already at the launch point)‚Äî-to the car, into/onto the car, to the launch point prepare it for use paddle it transport it again prepare it for storage occasional repair and maintenance If you live on the water or have an affordable convenient means of storing your board near the water you probably have no need of an inflatable. If you live in a small urban apartment or lack access to a vehicle with a roof rack and don‚Äôt have a good storage by point of use option you probably have no possibility of a rigid board. Inflating an SUP is a bit of a hassle and cleaning and drying it before it can go back in its bag is a chore. This is somewhat offset by not needing to take time to secure an object which would do incalculable damage if it came loose on a freeway. Inflatable SUP‚Äôs are incredibly resistant to damage during handling (windy parking lots, submerged stones, rocky shores). Fiberglass SUP‚Äôs need to be treated with more care. Patching pinhole leaks require much less skill than repairing fiberglass. The actual paddling performance of a rigid is categorically better, like an adult‚Äôs bicycle compared to a child‚Äôs. I owned a fairly high performance (for 2013) inflatable for the explicit purpose of surfing and while yes I could go catch waves and yes it was enormously better than not surfing and yes I‚Äôd rather be hit in the head with an inflatable, it was a bit like doing telemark turns in leather boots, fun for the fact that you‚Äôre out there and the challenge of doing it at all. The lack of stiffness (not just the rail‚Äî-the whole thing would fold up a bit on a steep wave) was significant. Meanwhile the adventure I imagined (mountain biking to remote beach breaks etc) fell apart in the face of the other gear (paddle, wetsuit, pump, drinking water, food and so on).

24575,,What conditions should lead an alpine team to abandon a mountain climb/expedition?,their clothing is not sufficient and they cannot borrow from someone else,"IMHO your turn around point ""developing hypothermia"" is too late . AFAIK, hypothermia usually doesn't happen out of the blue: there's a typical mix of exhaustion and not enough food, usually also accompanied by dehydration. There are also vicious cycles involved (being at one's limit and already slightly cold, possibly behind schedule, and therefore not making a break and in consequence skipping rest, food + drink => accelerating exhaustion). The turn around point should be well before that : when group/buddy check reveals that someone is too tired/slow already considering the way still to go (and the way to go back!), or that their clothing is not sufficient and they cannot borrow from someone else (e.g. they already wear everything they have while going => no safety margin in case more clothing is needed e.g. because of prolonged waiting* periods due to an accident/rescue/whatever.) * waiting isn't quite the right word, I mean anything that leads to less overall physical activity because circumstances necessitate slow, deliberate moving and thinking in between. doesn't (the group as a whole doesn't) have sufficient food or water Disclaimer: my knowledge/experience is less from moving in Alpine environments than from camping/wilderness tours, multi-day tours and more remote than many parts of, say, the Alps are.

Ventilation is also very important as you don't want moisture from your breathing to build up in the tent as you could wake up with your clothes wet. Winter tents will often have larger vestibules, as you will typically have more gear for winter camping than three season camping and you don't want all your gear covered with snow. A lot of winter tents will also be shorter than their three season counterparts.

4053,,What is the correct way to attach an autoblock to your harness for rappelling?,using a sling or something like the Metolius PAS,"Leg loop verses main belay loop You'll find recommendations for placing an autoblock on either the leg loop or the main belay loop. Some concerns about either placement are: Leg Loops If you're placing an autoblock on your leg loop AND you're using a ""quick release"" buckle, the carabiner that's holding the autoblock can catch on the buckle and release the tension on that leg loop. It probably wouldn't make you fall out of your harness, but would be uncomfortable, and you'd hang at an odd angle. The leg loops of a harness aren't strength-tested independently of the harness as a unit. Also, if the autoblock did manage to catch the entire weight of the climber, it would place a different stress on the leg loop than a person normally weighting the harness would. If you had a harness with stitched leg loops, like the Black Diamond Chaos, the weight of the autoblock would be pulling the stitches apart (this is not the direction of force you have when you weight a harness normally). I no longer put my autoblock on my leg loop for the reasons I mention above. I originally did, when I had a different harness, but my 2 current harnesses are the new Misty Mountain Cadallac, and the Black Diamond Chaos, one has quick release buckes, and the other has stiched leg loops. Belay Loop If you're placing an autoblock on your belay loop, you have to make sure and extend your belay device when rappeling (using a sling or something like the Metolius PAS). This issue is that if the loops of the autoblock are too close to the belay device, they can get caught in it, and jam the rappel system (probably making you unable to decend the rope, but possibly forcing the rope to ""fail open""). If you got stuck in this fashion, it would be pretty difficult to free yourself, esp. if you were in a free-hanging rappel. Sorry for not giving a single recommendation, as in many situations in climbing, there are multiple options, and its important to know what the tradeoffs are. Carabiner As per usual, you want to make sure your carabiner is loaded along its spine. That is, longways. So, one end of the carabiner will be running through the leg loop or belay loop, and the other end will have both strands of the autoblock coord. What I do I place my autoblock on my main belay loop, then extend my belay device with a PAS. The rope runs down between my legs, and I can use either hand to control my descent. My autoblock is made out of coord that I measured and cut specifically to be too short to catch up in my extended belay device.",using a sling or something like the Metolius PAS,0.111080065,1407,1455,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4053

6810,,What to look for in an ice axe for use in classic alpine terrain?,picking a length where the spike reaches your ankle,"For winter walking a traditional straight-shafted mountaineering axe seems most appropriate. This would include products like the very common BD Raven or Raven Pro, and also those with a slight bend such as the Petzl Summit, Grivel Air Tech Evo, and BD Venom. As there are existing questions regarding length ( How do I know what size ice axe I should get? ), I'll be brief and only repeat the traditional advice of holding it by the head with your arm hanging down and picking a length where the spike reaches your ankle. (E.g. I'm 185cm tall and use a 70cm axe. I would probably be happy with a 65cm length as well. Others may advise shorter lengths; this becomes more applicable as the slopes become steeper or you don't expect to use the axe for much of the route.) These days nearly all mountaineering axes have very similar features: a positively-curved steel head and adze, a steel spike, and a straight or slightly curved shaft. A few products deviate from this: Grivel's Futura replaced the adze with a plastic handle and Petzl's Sum'tec has a pick with negative curvature. Ultralight models may use aluminum for the head and eliminate the spike, but these are not suited for sustained use or harder snow and ice. A negative curvature pick may be useful on technical routes, but is not so good for self-arrest. A straight pick is somewhat old-fashioned and not commonly seen. Note that features on the shaft (finger rests, rubber handles, etc.) may make it more difficult to plunge the shaft. With modern crampons the adze is less used for chopping steps, although it's still quite useful if you need to carve out a platform or snow bollard. It's not until you get into dedicated ice tools that you run into significant differences: interchangeable picks, being able to select between a hammer, adze, or neither, significantly curved shafts, and very ergonomic handles. I personally don't use a leash, although some people do. Regardless of your choice, there are two very important rules to keep in mind. The first is Do Not Fall, and the second is Don't Let Go Of The Axe.

Do your best to find a spot that is somewhat sheltered from the wind. The lee of a crest usually works, but if you have wind blowing from all directions then try to find a recess in the ground - a low spot where the ground that slopes up in all directions away from your bed, just make sure the ground you're setting up on won't pool water. If you can, build up a wind screen around your tarp using rocks, even if the best you can manage is a short wind screen of only an unstacked ring of rocks around your tarp. Your priority is to seek shelter from the wind. It would be unwise to try and use your tarp to do this in such an exposed environment (not to mention deafeningly noisy). I've tried setting up a tent in the Nevada Desert with 90km+ wind gusts, personally, I think the easiest thing to do is simply lay your tarp flat on the ground, pile rocks around the edges then slip in underneath it. It's not worth bothering with poles and tie lines, you don't want any wind to get underneath your tarp. If no rocks are available, then your best bet would probably be to use the tarp as an emergency blanket, and wrap yourself up in it, then lay on top of the edges. If you're serious about trying to set up your tarp, the configuration I'd try first would be the Mushroom fly from the illustration below, which isn't much different from my suggestion to pile rocks on the edges of your tarp and slide in under it, except that you've got a small pole in the middle.",Mushroom fly,0.43302995,1364,1376,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8550

If you've exhausted the simple options (say it's been an hour and nothing is happening), this becomes more of a self-rescue situation, and self-rescue is based on improvising a solution using the gear you have and the techniques you know. Often in self-rescue, lowering the climber is the easiest solution. It would have worked here, but you had no way of knowing that, and it could have been dangerous to lower. So... If you were giving her a direct belay, then tying off the belay is trivial. If you were belaying off of your harness, then you need to know how to escape the belay, which is an important and fundamental self-rescue skill to practice. If you had less than half the rope out, then you could rappel down on a second strand to see what was up. However, you would need to formulate a plan to make sure you could get back up without having to solo the route, e.g., using a Prusik. The decision whether to attempt this might depend on the difficulty of the route. Because you can't extract your belay device from the system, you would need to do the rappel using an alternate technique such as a Munter. Another option might be to go and get help. Obviously that has disadvantages, but it beats attempting a self-rescue by a sketchy method that might get you killed. One of the basic rules of first aid and self-rescue is not to create additional victims.",rappel down,0.053412836,1149,1160,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9519

But, provided that it is done quite early before they choose to go away. Many other domesticated birds would join in too, mainly ravens and crows. Raptors usually take care of the uninvited ones. In my city, Raptors have a typical hunting region where ravens won't happily go to the party. If its already too late, the poor fellow is anyway going to die in most of the cases. If it is so, You shouldn't : Try to feed the prey if it is not dead yet. Try to shelter the prey if it is not dead yet. Try to shoo away raptors and ravens. Some things are supposed to happen, lets not disturb the balance of the nature. Feel bad that you couldn't help either of them. Edit: I don't know if you should kill it to relieve it off it's pain.

10507,,What is the most effective means of melting snow with body heat for drinking?,solar radiation,"The best way to melt snow is to put it in a bottle inside your jacket under your mid layers while you're on the move and let your body heat melt it. Do not place it against the skin, leave a layer or two between you and the bottle. It's advisable to always leave your bottle in your jacket in subzero temperatures, it can freeze if left in your bag. Melting snow by body heat is not a fast process, so some foresight is required on your part, if your bottle is getting empty, and you don't know when you're going to find running water next, then put some snow in your bottle to replace what you're drinking. Dropping snow in liquid water will help melt it faster than trying to melt a bottle of dry snow. Putting snow in your mouth is fine as long as you're warm, I do it all the time, but you are right that putting snow in your mouth will cool you down, so don't do it if you're already cold. If you are borderline hypothermic, then it would be unwise to try and expend additional body heat in order to melt snow, you need to get up, get moving, and get warm before you can even try it. This will be more difficult when you are dehydrated, as hydration has a huge role in hypothermia. One other option for melting snow is using solar radiation. Again, it's not a quick process, and you can only do it on a bright sunny day when the temperature is right. This is exactly how the survivors of the 1972 Andes flight disaster got water while they were stranded at the top of the snowy Andes mountains. They used reflective pieces of wreckage from the plane to catch the suns rays, and put small amounts of ice and snow on them then collected the drips in bottles to drink. They also ate each other... but that's another story .",solar radiation,0.845571995,1230,1245,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10507
10627,,What is the safest and most effective additive to keep drinking water from freezing?,NaF,"There are two natural options; none of them is quite pleasant. Alcohol Per Wikipedia , 8.5 vol% of ethanol make the freezing point drop to -3C (26.6F) (more values at at Wikipedia, also a diagram is available below). Most of the ethanol will be evaporized during cooking, so it's not that much an issue; also 14 vol% is only 6.8 wt%, so the added weight is 6.8%, which sounds like a lot, but still it's 1/15 only. The good thing is that you can get cheap and quite strong alcohol almost anywhere around the world. Of course, this has some issues, such as where to get spare alcohol for a longer journey; also, some alcohol will be always left in the solution, no matter how hard you try, which is not good at winter. Note that you can get a 90% alcohol at special shops, but it can get quite expensive because of the excise tax. Don't buy technical alcohol, it's denaturated, i.e. very disguisting and possibly not really safe to drink . Salts Note that you can't really do much with salts. The most efficient salt is NaF ( sodium fluoride ). However, it is poisonous, lethal dose is around 8g/100kg weight. We can compute that even a huge amount such as 34 grams of NaF in 1 litre of water reduce the freezing point to -3C. However, that's 3.4 wt%, which is freakingly lot. For NaCl ( kitchen salt ), the amount to get to -3C is 47 grams, so almost 5%. Since the relationship is linear, any reasonable amount of salt has close to zero effect on the freezing point.

14278,,What precautions should we take in situations when hiking or walking through tall grass?,direction,"When you mentioned tall grass, snakes weren't the first thing that came to my mind. Snakes can hide in plain site, let aside the taller grass. They typically want to hide, unless you aren't really entering their hide-outs. For snakes that you find in Western Ghats, they typically have their habitat in thickets and holes. Very rarely you'll come across a snake in a grassland, typically when its their basking time, and I haven't seen a snake basking in such tall grass, because it doesn't make sense. The only possibility that you come across snake if it is passing through, but eventually like most of the times it will know that something (you) are coming closer. An argument can be made that if it is so, why people in India usually get bitten by a snake or come across one while they are in a sugarcane farm or a rice farming? And, the only possible valid reason I can think of is presence of rats and other preys that snakes happily feast on. The other animals you need to be aware of are hyenas and wolves. I have heard of and met people who have excelled at walking without making any noise. When I tried the same over a period of time and finally succeeded at it, I came across a Bison, not exactly in that taller grass, but in a similar region. So, be loud if you want to make sure you keep them away if they are around at all. Apart from snakes there are other things you want to be aware of while walking in tall grass. The most important of them is direction. In that case I usually refer a hill or a distant mountain as a landmark before getting into such tall grass. Additionally you can refer your GPS application periodically to check if you are heading into the direction you are supposed to, if you are equipped with it. This might be specific to the region we trek/hike around: Taller grass in Western Ghat (Well, most part of it) is seasonal. I consider season before I plan any such routes, but obviously if find yourself in a situation that you have to pass through one such long region, bang your feet (not such that it starts hurting your knees) as you walk and make sure you are with: A proper trekking attire: A full pant, a shirt with full sleeves, preferably a hat or a cap. Shoes! A walking stick which you can use to push aside the grass on the route. Do not slaughter the grass through the way, you can bend it enough to let yourself and your team pass. I am somewhat against that Machete thing. Using a stick effectively would help you judge what you are stepping into. I have seen people getting their ankles twisted because they didn't see what they stepped onto/into.

14622,,What are the correct techniques for rescuing someone who has fallen through the ice?,"a plank, a ladder or a branch","Most important: Be prepared! On organized skating tours (at least in sweden) the following is mandatory equipment. An ice probe (to determine ice thickness so you wont go through in the first place) A backpack with a complete change of clothes in a watertight bag. The backpack must have a harness that goes between your legs so it doubles as a flotation device and can be used to pull you out of the water. Ice claws/spikes/""Isdubbar"" (If you do go through, you stab them into the ice for traction) A rescue line. A line with a floating weight and a fixed loop in each end. Must be easily accessible even in water. This is equipment that both the person in the water and people around are likely to have, even far from populated areas. Once someone is in the water however, there are several means of rescue. Best Rescue helicopter. Lets you get to the person in the water without putting the rescuer at risk. Lets you transport a hypothermic or injured victim safely. This naturally is overkill in most cases. Second best A surf board or similar, that can be pushed out onto thin ice by spreading the load, and what floats if the ice breaks. The victim can grab the board and get up/be pulled up, or a rescuer can lay flat on it grabbing the victim while a second rescuer pushes/pulls the board from behind. There are custom built boards designed for this. Naturally a plank, a ladder or a branch will do in an emergency. Anything that spreads the load, ideally floats and/or puts some distance between rescuer and victim. A small boat works too, but might be harder to reach up to from the water. Note: I put this as ""second best"", but only if such items are at hand. If you have a rescue line ant the victim is uninjured, don't waste time looking for a plank. Third best A line with a floating weight and a bowline (fixed loop) on both ends. Throw it to the victim. (Or even better, if the victim has one he/she can throw it to a rescuer) Either put the bowline around your wrist or (if you came prepared) attach it to a carabiner on your backpacks harness. Fourth best Self rescue. Never go on natural ice unprepared! Wear something that will help you float. (Dry suit, life jacket or a water tight backpack) Bring a pair of ""isdubbar"" (Swedish. Don't know an english term) or simply two large nails. Stab them into the ice to get traction enough to get back up. In any case, make sure that no one else falls through.

Cooking away from your sleeping area is always a good precaution, and never eat or bring food into your tent. A PDF from CapitolRiders.org points out some of the precautions you can take: Handle food with care. For the best bear-deterring actions, obey this list: Do cook at least 100 yards (91 meters) from your tent. Do change clothes after cooking and keep those clothes elsewhere from your sleeping area. Do not ever leave food unattended, not even for moment to go to the stream to get water. Make sure it is guarded by others at the campsite or is put away. Your technique of cooking/eating at one site and then moving to the next should work perfectly (so long as they are far enough apart - I imagine they are). As for disposing of the byproducts of cooking, I would dump anything that won't harm the environment even further away from the cooking site so that others who may use the site won't be in danger. I would think that grease shouldn't impact the environment so it should be safe to dump. For things that you should not just leave (things that constitute as pollution), you can use another bear bag or garbage bag to hold all of these things and hang it just like you would with your food. It may be smarter to hang this one separately from and further from the bear bag that contains your food.

16345,,What are the most likely causes of unfilterable water contamination in upland UK areas?,Run-off from mining Run-off from agriculture Algal blooms,"Viral infection Assuming you have a quality filter which genuinely removes bacteria and protozoa, you are probably safer from viral infection than you think. Viruses are quite likely to be present in upland water via contamination from human and animal faeces. But they don't tend to exist in isolation - they are normally attached to larger organisms such as bacteria. I've discussed this at length with a filter expert who was involved in a large test for the UK military. They found that quality filters were removing viruses effectively, even though viruses were theoretically small enough to pass through the filter. Based on this advice I've drunk some heavily contaminated water in the Alps using a good filter, with no ill effects. I also walk weekly on Dartmoor, where the water is quite infected by humans and stock, and the filter has protected me. To be doubly sure, you could carry some purification tablets for use in sketchy situations, but I haven't felt the need and I've lived to tell the tale. Personally I'll drink unfiltered if the source is fast-flowing and high on the hill, but otherwise I filter. In the UK the risks are modest and many people drink straight from the stream. But the consequences of an infection can be pretty unpleasant, and as filtering is so easy I prefer to be safe. Chemical contamination Most portable filters are not effective in removing chemicals. The three main issues are: Run-off from mining Run-off from agriculture Algal blooms. In the UK, it's normally fairly trivial to avoid these contaminants. In areas that have been mined you might want to ask locally if you are planning to camp low down. On the tops you should be above any mine-works. Personally I avoid drinking water below arable farmland - this is not usually an issue in the hills if you plan ahead - just source your water on the higher passages of your walks. On coastal paths I'll carry enough water to get me to the next reliable source. With a filter, you can drink safely from the taps in toilets, from fountains, and from similar sources without having to resort to bottled water. Blooms are rare in the UK and should be obvious if encountered. Given our climate, there is usually a running source above the infected body of water. A quality filter should be all you need in UK conditions So with a little common-sense and planning a good filter should see you through. There's no need to exaggerate the risks, but it's worth taking basic precautions whenever there is any doubt about water quality.",Run-off from mining Run-off from agriculture Algal blooms,0.467445701,1426,1483,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16345

You would typically use whatever retired climbing rope you can get your hands on, as purchasing new rope specifically for this would be very costly. If using rock climbing rope , the the type, whether static or dynamic, dry treated or not, is unlikely to make a difference . The loads on such a rope (1/8 bodyweight per strand of an 8 strand braided rope) are so low that any stretch in the rope itself will be negligible . The one thing that would make a difference is the rope diameter , as an 8mm rope would obviously lead to a braided rope 20% narrower than what you'd get from a 10mm rope . And I would estimate that a 10mm rope in an 8-strand braid would get you close to 1.5 inches final diameter . You could use polyester rope if you really need it to be less likely to absorb water , but unless you're using it to climb out of the ocean, I can't imagine that would be a concern. If you do use polyester, make sure the rope you obtain is double-braided rather than twisted , as the latter will be much less comfortable to grip . ( Double-braided is a sheath and core construction , similar to the kernmantle design of rock climbing ropes.) Making the braid without cutting the rope is also possible, but limits your options, would be less neat and harder to work with. Are you really going to go to all the effort of braiding it just to undo the rope and use it for something else later? Much better to just get a used rope for cheap, and braid it with no intention of even undoing it. It sounds like you've already figure out how to braid it without cutting, but here's an image to illustrate it. (Click to enlarge.) This approach requires that you follow the pattern for a four strand round braid , but using a pair of strands instead of single strands , thereby doubling the total number of strands to eight . The final product will have strands always running in pairs. An alternative pattern that you could use if you cut the rope is to do a proper eight strand round braid , where the strands are braided individually instead of in pairs, resulting in a smoother, more evenly round final product .",double-braided,0.071242198,1069,1083,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16714

Now, it isn't an exact thing as this current fall/winter is showing. The forecast was that there was plenty of food up north. But, we are already having a number of reports of pine siskins and crossbills. Crossbills are usually very uncommon in NE Ohio. But, there are at least two flocks being reported right now.

I will add something else that I learned from a number of organizations that do bird banding.

There is really no way to tell unless the birds have been banded and are recaptured. (Banding is a low-return activity. Only a fraction of banded birds are ever recovered. But, it is one of the only way to try to track bird movements. GPS/satellite trackers are coming down in size and cost. They may be the future of tracking the smaller songbirds. They are used in some larger birds now like hawks and cranes.) Birds like the siskens, crossbills and others like evening grosbeaks are easy to label as they don't normally live here in Ohio.

Within B√∏rgefjell, there are no markers, few trails, few bridges, and just a handful of (emergency) shelters. The lack of markers is a conscious decision out of respect for the local Sami traditions, so this is unlikely to change. Due to the very low level of visitation and the relatively open terrain, it is unlikely that any trails will socially develop apart from the limited sections where they already exist. This section of the E1 required extensive wilderness experience. An example of the landscape along the route: Scenery along the E1 The E1 crosses the snowfield visible near the top. If the E1 through B√∏rgefjell appears too wild, there is an easy alternative on the Swedish side.

Here we pass the boundary with B√∏rgefjell National Park. From the bridge we head straight south between the streams and follow the ridge up to Kraejhpie where we get out of the forest. Continue south and pass point 857 and follow the stream before we reach a river and reindeer fence where it makes a swing. We cross the river underneath the reindeer fence and follow the west side of the fence and river for around 2 km. We get a larger distance from the river and pass west of lake 960 and over the heights between points 1060 and 1033. A bit down to cross the stream coming out of Reinhornvatnet and through the pass a bit west of height 1002. Now we turn SW and pass the meanders in the Ranser river before we cross it.

On the inside of the bay there is swamp all the way down to the lake, so we try to go on the inside of the swamps and thus turn SE. Cross Matbekken and hold the same height until we are above the mouth of Orrelva. Approaching the river and crossing it on a bridge ca. 800 m above the mouth of Orrelva. Can now go around height 556 on the N-side or go over it to Storvika and continue along the lakeshore for around 1 km. Here we leave B√∏rgefjell National Park.

19083,,What is the minimum grade of the routes set in the IFSC world cups?,one route and one attempt per competitor,"Regarding Grading That's a very common question for people new to competition climbing. Route setting for competition is in general quite different than for ""regular"" gym routes. Route setters at comps have several, sometimes conflicting requirements, which also vary depending on the round (quali, semi, finals): Create spread Nothing more unnerving than having competitors tied and needing to resort to previous round to resolve the ranking. New and diverse problem types You don't want to do problems that the competitors do every day and you need to have difficulties for all kinds of body types to prevent an advantage for one. Often at comps special holds or such that aren't yet commercially available are used. Spectacle You have a live audience to capture and on a bigger scale, promote the sport. It is especially important in finals, that's why often finals are a bit easier and potential more straight forward than quali/semi. In an ideal final, all these points are fulfilled Suspense: The winner is decided on the last boulder. Tops: Every problem is topped at least once to showcase every move. Circus: A great climbing problem isn't necessarily great to watch. That's part of why you see huge dynamic moves , 360¬∞ campussing, ... All of this means that there can't be any strict rules. There is a big team of route setters at work and to try and fulfill all of the above points (and probably more I am not aware of/didn't think about now). Their routes also aren't set in stone: They obviously set their routes in advance, but they adapt routes in between rounds to adjust them to how the competitors are performing. Also modern style (well it's true for a while) competition bouldering is focussed on big volumes. Sure there is always a slab in there, but you see almost no steep, crimpy, teeth grinding boulders. That's partly for spectacle and setting uncommon problems, partly to prevent finger injuries. Meaning they are hard to compare to ""normal"" boulders. You probably expierenced that in a gym too: Big unconventional routes don't necessarily fit in your personal route ranking, because they might not suit you. That's generally true, but much more so in those kind of routes. TLDR: There is no such thing as a minimal grade in comps. Setting comp routes is an experience base art and a kind of ""shadow-competition"", trying to get the perfect set of routes to the wall to cater the competitors and watchers needs. Note about lead : Most points also apply there, but as there is just one route and one attempt per competitor, it's even harder to set right. And it's even more obvious that you can't grade them, as they usually start of significantly easier than they end. Regarding standards I am not aware of either a written standard (at wold / IFSC level) or a fixed course syllabus to become a route setter. As far as I am aware, it still works in the usual way for emerging sports: You start off locally, get experience, get to know relevant people, get the knack of it and have fun. Then you start setting local competitions and show your prowess, get to know more people, go national and by that time it's just a question of whether you are willing to keep up the probably huge work effort to keep setting at that level. If you do, you're name will probably pop up as chief route-setter at a world cup eventually.

20549,,What are the pros and cons of first vs second focal plane rifle scopes?,they usually cost more,"The technical difference is on which focal plane the reticle is etched on, at the focal plane between the objective and the image erector lens system (the First Focal Plane (FFP)), or the focal plane between the image erector lens system and the eyepiece (the Second Focal Plane (SFP)). Source While the practical difference is that a FFP reticle will increase in size when you increase the magnification on a variable magnification scope while a SFP reticle will stay the same size. This mostly comes into play when you have a scope with a mil-dot reticlee for ranging targets/game. If you have an SFP scope, then it will only work at one magnification, while an FFP scope will stay constant. For example, at 25 yards I need to aim 2 inches/8 MOA high. With an FFP scope, I can aim 8 MOA high regardless of the magnification power my scope is set to while if I had an SFP scope, I would be stuck at trying aim 2 inches high at that looks different at depending on the magnification power the scope is currently set to.

20941,,What are the most important numerical features to look for when comparing climbing ropes?,how the rope handles,"It depends... What matters depends on what kind of climbing you plan to do. Length matters if you‚Äôre climbing (and/or rappelling) routes longer than 25 meters. In some areas, a 80m rope is essential, in others a 50m will do just fine. Impact force matters if you climb on marginal protection. (Ice, hard trad, aid) Diameter matters if you put the rope to heavy use, since a fatter rope takes more wear. Also the diameter must be compatible with your brake. Thinner is easier to feet through a belay device, but might take more practice to belay safely with. number of UIAA falls matters if you work hard on redpointing. I.e if you fall a lot. Weight matters if you want to push your grades. Dry treatment matters on multi-pitch climbing and is vital on ice. Not so important for sport crafting though. What also matters a lot is how the rope handles. (Though that is not clear from technical specs). Some ropes become twisted and tangled easier than others. (Edit after additional information in question) For indoors use, get a short (50m will be enough at almost any gym) durable (ie not too thin, 10-10.2 mm perhaps) rope. Don‚Äôt bother with dry treatment, obviously.

21059,,What should I consider when planning my first multiple-day hiking trip on hills?,topography,"I'm used to walking for longer distances a few times, even up to like 30KM on kinda even areas, but I've never done a multiple day trip in a hilly area. One important differences between (multiple) day tours and a multi-day hike is that you need to keep enough strength to do all the setting up of camp and cooking. I.e., you don't want to arrive exhausted - that would be sure way to have a very miserable experience (you'll get cold and miserable, and it will take you ages to warm up your sleeping bag so you can actually sleep). And you're going to carry considerably more weight in your backpack. Both aspects can vary in their extent, depending on how exactly you plan your tour. If you plan to stay at official campgrounds and even to get a warm meal at a pub, that will make things much easier compared to doing a completely self-reliant tour. A few more thoughts: Water is usually unproblematic in Germany: you'll be sufficiently close to/passing villages so you can ask for tap water at least 2 times per day. As long as you're reasonably comfortable reading a topographical map, that's all the navigation equipment you need for the Odenwald. If you're uneasy about direction, you can bring a compass. But even in fog, the Odenwald has a very dense net of roads, so you'd not loose that much time to get to a point where you reliably know where you are, and the topography is easy (hills and valleys with villages in the bottom) You may be surprised how much food you'll need staying outdoors all day. And how much clothing you'll want to keep you warm sitting in camp in a November evening. Also (until you're sufficiently experienced to know your slepping needs well enough) we're in season 4 in terms of the sleeping bag now. Both are essential for not getting cold and miserable. If you get cold, you won't be able to sleep (that's good: it our natural protection against freezing to death). But without proper sleep, and probably more of that than usual because of the unusual excercise and being outdoors all the time, you'll be even more miserable and cold... Good news is: this time of the year the night is sufficently long to allow you to sleep long - even if you wake up a couple of times because of strange noises or the ground being hard. Putting up a tent to stay overnight officially requires permission of the land owner (the difficulty in Germany is to find out whom you need to ask), source for Odenwald tours: Hessisches Waldgesetz . However, some regions now offer a few so-called trekking camps (Trekkingplatz) where you are allowed to put your tent in the forest - usually you can book a site via internet. For the ones I'm aware of, not in November though (hunting season, forestry season, and trying to lower the permanent stress level for wildlife during winter). In the S√§chsische Schweiz you can stay in a Boofe - not even carrying a tent :-) Open fire in forests + 100 m surroundings outside official fire/BBQ places are a big no-no unless you have a permission by the forester (and I'd say currently it is still rather dry after the draught this summer). This is a consideration if you're planning to start your wild camping experience this time of the year. This time of the year really isn't the traditional season to get into (wild) camping. I'd say, it comes with a good chance of putting you in about the most difficult weather conditions for camping we have here: slightly above 0¬∞C, constantly wet/raining and windy. It is basically impossible to stay dry in these conditions, and that makes keeping warm a major task (the more so, if you plan without hot food because of the no-fire-in-the-forest-rule*). It is much easier to have fun camping with reliably freezing temperatures. In the Odenwald (and many other German regions) you're never really far from civilization. In other words, in case you need to get out, e.g. because you wake up at 2 am finding your tent is leaky and you're really soaked, you'll be within less than 5 km and most of that on drivable forest paths which do not pose any particular difficulty even for hiking out during the night from some kind of place/village with mobile phone connection where you phone for a taxi to bring you back to your car. Unless a considerable number of mistakes add up, you may be totally miserable, but unlikely to end up in a really dangerous situation. (Wild) camping tours can be lots of fun, even in November weather :-) But wouldn't it be a shame if you totally miss out on that fun because your first experience is absolutely miserable? Consider starting ""softly"", with other people, after trying out your equipment in a rainy night at home, or after doing a long day tour that includes having dinner outdoors, etc. (Btw, I'm just 125 km away from HD and I'd be willing to join forces for a tour. I'd suggest a day tour first, though) * Forest fire is no problem in such conditions.

958,,What levels of 'waterproofness' and 'breathability' should I be looking for in a ski jacket?,5000,"As a rough guide to waterproofness - 5000mm is generally rainproof but won't necessarily stand up well to torrential rain. Around 15000 should be fine in that context. If you go higher than that then you're looking at fabric that can be immersed in water and still stay waterproof for a while, but should be ample for any rain shower that might come along! Breathability works on a similar scale, 5000 being ok-ish, but 15000-20000 is where it makes sense to look if you get very hot and sweaty. Don't use these figures as gospel though, there's no standard testing practice so results will vary slightly. Some companies will test when new for instance, others after some washes, some will take an average, some will take the best... also bear in mind that these tests are carried out while the fabric is still, not moving, so results might vary slightly because of that. In short, use them as a rough guide but they're definitely not the be all and end all in choosing a product.",5000,0.570560634,397,401,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/958

I've been in this situation once when hiking with my father. My father went up to the bear and yelled. The bear reared up and roared, my father ran like hell, and the bear went back to eating our box of crackers. This seems to match up with what I've heard, which is that once the bear has your food, the bear knows that it owns the food. One way to prevent this kind of problem is to eat dinner in the late afternoon, then hike some more, and then camp. Also, I am asking specifically about black bears encountered in the wilderness, not those who have grown accustomed to people near camp-grounds. Well, the distinction between backcountry and front-country, habituated versus unhabituated, is probably not that black and white. There's a whole spectrum from crowded car-camping campgrounds to remote, high-altitude areas that are far from trails and hardly ever visited by humans. Somewhere in the middle of this spectrum you have backcountry areas such as Little Yosemite and Rae Lakes that are popular enough to need bear boxes. In my experience, if you camp in areas that are not popular enough to need bear boxes, you simply never see a bear, and it's not an issue. Bears aren't like marmots, which are pretty commonly encountered even in the alpine zone at very high elevation. A bear is a big top predator that can only get enough food in either a pretty productive ecosystem (i.e., at relatively low altitude) or in an area where it can steal human food reliably and in significant quantities.",my father ran like hell,0.025543967,186,209,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4587
4798,,What are the first aid precautions to be taken in case of a snake bite?,Do NOT take anything by mouth,"There is hardly anything very effective first aid as such, considering the fact that you are 5 hrs walk from any medical facility. I guess I can assume that you will be roaming in rain forests of Agumbe or anywhere in Southern Western Ghats since you referred to King Cobras. If in India, you would definitely like to take a look at The Big Four . Considering the region where you refer, There are two types of venomous snakes you should know about: Neurotoxic: Indian Spectacled Cobra, King Cobra. (You won't find Monocled or Caspian Cobras in that region), Kraits. Haemotoxic : All Vipers. (Bamboo Pit Viper aka Green Pit Viper, Saw Scaled Viper, Malabar Pit Viper, Russell's Viper). Malabar Pit Vipers are very rare in Indian Subcontinent, so it is unlikely that you will come across one. I doubt if there are any Chemotoxic snakes in india. There can't be because I have enlisted every possible Fatally Venomous snake in India that I know about. Firstly: Usually venomous snakes tend to preserve their venom (except for Juveniles). So, once it bites, it retreats. But still try and ensure that the snake is at a safer distance and get away from it in order to avoid another bite. Secondly, To make the anti-venom work efficiently on you, you should try and gather some visual information about the snake that bit you. Don't try to capture the snake or kill it and bring it with you, but try to capture a picture of the snake from your cellphone/camera (if available), or somehow try and remember it's color and shape so that it can be described, which will help in choosing the right anti-venom. (Specific to India) - The big 4 in India are Cobras, Saw-scaled Vipers, Russell's Vipers, Kraits. They don't really give you much time to get to the hospital. But this doesn't mean that one should hurry. Keep calm, panic will make the adrenaline come in picture and the blood circulation will increase, only resulting in causing the venom to spread much quicker. If you are going to be carried (on a stretcher), then lie flat, avoiding the movements. Allow the bitten part of the body to be lower than the Heart level. Do not let anyone try to suck the venom out of the bite site. (I have heard cases of such a horrid thing done, and the one who sucked also got to be treated as the venom in victim's blood entered the sucker's blood through minute injuries in his gum/teeth). Wrap a large constricting band between the bite site and the Heart, so that the blood mixed with venom reaching to heart is controlled. Wrap is snugly, Do not wrap it very tight or else the venom will damage the entire limb. Usually in such a case, the limb has to be amputated. No one would want to loose the limb if the snake has not injected the amount of venom enough to be fatal. (Have ever heard of a Dry-Bite?? Vipers do that often!) (Specific to Neurotoxic snakes) - If it is a cobra or a king cobra, try and be awake and communicate with the people who are carrying you. Try not to make cuts around bite site as it swells. It will swell, no matter what. Do not apply any kind of disinfectant or tourniquet. Remove any rings or tightly constricting items because the affected area will swell. Do NOT take anything by mouth such as caffeine or alcohol or any painkillers at all. As different wiki's say, Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant. Stimulants may produce a variety of different kinds of effects by enhancing the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since Caffeine is a Bronchodilator, which is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs. If we can relate elevated heart rate due to panicked state of mind and/or adrenaline, and the consequent elevated respiration rate, we should prefer to avoid consuming caffeine which is a Bronchodilator and a Stimulant. (Specific to India) - Kraits are nocturnal species. Usually these are spotted during late hours of day and night. If you are asleep (as you normally will), it is hard to realize that you are bitten by a Krait since the bite feels like an ant or a mosquito bite and the actual bite is not significantly visible. The symptoms of such a bite are: The facial muscles get tight in one to two hours, may be unable to talk or see due to it's Neurotoxic venom.

To my knowledge, all locks on the Upper Mississippi are accessible via paddling. As for the Ohio river, you can try calling McAlpine lock and dam , and they'll be able to answer for sure what the situation is on the Ohio river. To use the lock, when you approach the lock, there should be a section at the entrance of the concrete wall with a signal rope, hopefully well marked. Paddle up to the rope and pull it, and that will signal the lock operators. They'll then instruct you on what to do. Going through locks is not a rapid operation, and priority is allocated to commercial traffic, so you may be waiting for awhile prior to entry. See the following brochure for further info, it has information on the hazards and restricted areas surrounding locks: Locks and Rivers . I'd recommend reading that because since the locks are built where elevation drops the fastest, the pools, dams, and weirs around the locks can be deathtraps if you paddle where you aren't supposed to. Bring rope 75 to 100 feet of rope. When you enter the lock, the lock master will lower a rope on a hook, put the center of your rope over the hook.

7418,,What is an effective way to join a map that is printed on several sheets?,put a small piece of tape,"Many printer drivers and other software allow you to ""tile"" a large document or a magnified one on multiple pages. You can usually specify the overlap between pages, which only needs to be enough for you to cut cleanly. 0.1 inch is usually good enough. Acrobat reader may even have such a option. I know I've done this a few times with my printer, a Lexmark Pro905. That printer is a piece of crap, and I definitely NOT recommend getting one, but the procedure has worked. I don't rememer if the tiling capability was in the printer software or the app. Look around. Once you have the tiles printed on separate piece of paper, you have to trim off the excess paper from one tile for each overlap. Line them up carefully, then put a small piece of tape at each end of the overlap. Continue until all tiles are taped together, even though loosly. Now put a piece of tape over each seam. First do this on top where you can see what you're doing and can be sure the alignment isn't getting messed up. Then flip the whole thing over and tape the seams on the back. At this point you don't have to be that careful anymore because all the alignments have already been fixed by the tape over the seams on the front side. No, the whole thing isn't going to feel like a single piece of paper. You will definitely notice the seams being stiffer when you try to fold it. That's the way it is.

9908,,What materials from nature can I use to make a hunting bow in the wilderness?,linseed or tung oil,"In addition to the already given answers, I've found a in-depth guide on how to build a bow (full credit goes to Jason Knight). How to Make a Quickie Bow from a Sapling 1. Choosing wood The first step is to select the proper materials. Some of the best woods for making bows include osage orange, yew, ash, black locust, and hickory, though most hardwoods can work (other examples of hardwoods include oak, maple, and beech). For a quickie bow, you want to start with a relatively straight section of sapling or branch that is free of knots, side branches, and twists. You want this straight section to be about 5 feet long and about 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter. Cut the sapling or branch carefully so not to create cracks or splits in the wood. This is your bow stave. 2. Finding the belly, back, handhold, and limbs Stand the bow stave upright on the ground, hold the top loosely with one hand, and push outward lightly on the middle of the bow. The stave will swivel to show you which way it is slightly curved. The outside bend of the curve is called the ""back"" and the inside bend of the curve is the ""belly"". Leave the ""back"" of the bow untouched. The back receives the most tension and any damage to it can cause the bow to break. This is one of the most important bow making instructions. Now find the middle point of the stave and mark out your handhold area by measuring and marking 3 inches out from the center in both directions. The handhold area will also be left relatively untouched. The area above the handhold is the upper limb and the area below is the lower limb. 3. Shaping Now put the bottom tip of the bow on top of your foot and hold the top tip while pushing outward from the belly side of the handhold. Only push outward a few inches. Look at how the limbs bend. Observe which areas bend and which areas do not. Begin removing wood with a knife from the belly of the limbs where they do not bend while leaving material in the areas of the limbs that bend a lot. Remember: only remove wood from the belly side of the limbs, leave the back untouched. The goal at this step in the process is to get the limbs to bend evenly in the shape of a parabolic curve (like a satellite dish) throughout their entire length. Take off material slowly and re-check the bend of the limbs frequently. The handhold and tips should stay straight or have very little bend. You are ready for the next step of bow making instructions once both limbs are no longer stiff and are able to flex evenly throughout their length ‚Äì thick staves will take lots of carving, while narrow diameter staves may only need very little shaping. 4. Notches for the bow string You can now carve small notches on the both sides of each tip, being careful not to carve into the back of the bow. They only need to be deep enough to keep a bow string in place. Tie loops into both ends of a nylon, sinew, or plant fiber string, using a length that will allow there to be 5 to 6 inches between the string and the handhold when the bow is strung. String the bow; though be careful not to pull back on the string yet (doing so can break the bow). Now you're ready for the next bow making instructions. 5. Tillering Hang the bow up horizontally on a branch or piece of scrap wood by the handhold. Now pull down a few inches on the string while observing how the limbs bend. Now, not only do you want each limb to bend evenly throughout its length, you also want each limb to bend exactly the same amount (a mirror image of each other). Tillering is also one of the most important bow making instructions. Observe which limb bends less and carefully remove more materials from the belly of that limb until both limbs bend equally and evenly. Re-check frequently, pulling down on the string a little bit further each time until you are able to pull it to your draw length (Your draw length can be measured by imagining to hold a bow and pull the string back to your upper jaw to a shooting position ‚Äì the distance between the handhold and your upper jaw is your draw length). The tillering process is complete once both limbs flex equally and evenly and the draw weight (pounds of pressure required to pull the string back to a full draw) is at your desired poundage. A 25 to 35 pound draw is sufficient enough for hunting small game while 40 to 60 pounds is needed for larger animals like deer. The poundage can be tested by placing a five foot 2x4 piece of lumber vertically on a bathroom scale, then balancing the bow horizontally by the handhold on top of the piece of lumber and pulling down on the string to a full draw length. The scale will register the draw weight. 6. Finishing For wilderness survival situations the bow can now be used as is. Be sure to never ""dry"" fire the bow (dry firing is when the string is pulled back and let go without an arrow). This can break a bow. To finish it off you can sand the belly smooth and oil it with a light oil to prevent it from drying out too quickly. Many bowyers prefer linseed or tung oil. To care for your bow, shoot it and oil it frequently and adjust the tiller as needed. We hope you've found these bow making instructions helpful. Enjoy!

10165,,What are the most frequent crimes perpetrated by people against people in the Great Outdoors?,attempted/successful homicide and/or sexual assault,"tl;dr Be smart, be aware, and you don't need to worry very much about people, but they can be a risk factor depending on where you go and what you're doing. ShemSeger's answer sums up my general impression of the types of crimes/interactions that I would be most concerned about, ie vandalism and/or ""territorial"" disputes. My comment that you referenced was mostly to stress: That animal encounters where the animal is likely to attack you are rare. It is often the things we don't worry about , other people being one of them, that can get us into trouble. People go into the wilderness for all kinds of reasons, so I think it stands to reason that all kinds of people will go into the wilderness. In general the proportion of honest citizens to criminals you meet on any given day, in the city, heavily balances toward the honest citizens (unless you're some kind of criminal ring leader). That means that I would expect that the vast majority of people you meet in the wilderness are good, honest people, but there will invariably be some criminals . Also, the wilderness offers reduced oversight by law enforcement so it will attract a certain kind of criminal. To a certain degree criminality in the wilderness will be affected by what type of crimes you're talking about. Does underage drinking count? Does negligence leading to a major wildfire count? Does intentional arson count? etc... There are some crimes like attempted/successful homicide and/or sexual assault that clearly count so I'll highlight some of those statistics. In rural Northern California I know Mexican Cartels, some Native Americans, and some locals have been known to grow marijuana illegally on Forest Service land. My brother-in-law has been shot at multiple times while performing drug interdiction duties. My father has been warned off land by people in no uncertain terms while hunting. Furthermore he has seen bowls of anti-freeze scattered about the woods to kill any animals that might be inclined to forage on the illegal crops. This is a danger, but mostly to hunters because recreational hikers will rarely venture far enough off the beaten path. Full disclosure I'm not a woman, nor a particularly attractive man. I don't worry about sexual assault but according to this website there is an above average risk of sexual assault in Yosemite National Park (159 vs national average of 100). They also give a risk of 294 vs the national average of 100 for physical assault in YNP. I don't know if those numbers are accurate, but if they are then people are clearly a threat. Another website 1 that may or may not be accurate states this about YNP (danger rating 2 10.3): While the three women hikers murdered outside park boundaries last year made headlines, theft from park hotel rooms is more common. Here is what they say about Everglades (danger rating 10.8): It's not the notorious gators that pose the biggest hazards here -- there has been only one unprovoked attack in the last 53 years -- it's car break-ins. Indeed, the park has an unusually high number of larcenies per visitor. According to that website Lake Mead, NV 3 has the ""highest rate of serious crime of the parks we looked at"" and has a danger rating of 13.6. In closing here is a report from ABC News : ""Just about any type of crime that goes on in any urban environment happens out here,"" said Dale Antonich, chief ranger at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, located in Nevada and Arizona. ""We've had rapes, we've had murders in the park, we've had bodies dumped in the park,"" Antonich said. ... And yet, as troubling as urban crime may be, it is nothing compared to the lawlessness we found in parks along the nation's borders. ... The rangers at Organ Pipe wear camouflage and bulletproof vests, and carry assault rifles. They look like special forces soldiers on patrol in Iraq, but they are park rangers on duty in what rangers believe is the most dangerous park in America. 1: This data/page appears to be ~20 years old. 2: Incidents per 100k visitors including crime and accidents. 3: Note this is relevant to the area that my comment was placed.",attempted/successful homicide and/or sexual assault,0.658330321,1424,1475,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10165
11085,,What are the main disadvantages to a kiteboat in terms of long distance bluewater sailing?,upwind performance,"The examples on the site only show inshore sports sailing with a hydrofoil. This does look like fun, and downwind performance can be exceptional. Though I doubt that inshore fleet racing would be possible as the kites would surely get tangled. As for bluewater sailing, it seems that no-one is arguing that it is practical with current technology. Masts hold sails up in light air, but a kite is going to fall at times. Even with adequate wind speed they need careful nursing to prevent stalling. Fallen rigs are hard to handle and relaunch can be impossible in difficult conditions. Do you fancy having the kite and rigging under your hull in the Southern Ocean? Or tangled under another boat in congested waters? With current designs the minimum practical wind-speed is around 10k per hour. At present lighter-than-air kites that would stay aloft in light winds (using helium, for example) aren't seen as workable. In tight situations such as busy ports or estuaries the kite would also be impractical and probably dangerous. In the demo films they are sometimes flying over other people's masts which seems pretty questionable. And they only just made it under the Golden Gate, so most bridges would be too low. Another major issue is upwind performance. Current kite designs have a lift-to-drag ratio of around half that of a conventional rig, meaning that they can make less than half the speed upwind. Tacking is tricky, so you are generally restricted to gybing. You are also restricted to sailing light hulls, as the largest workable kites are still quite small. Finally, there's the question of handling gusts and squalls. With current kite designs control is cumbersome and there is a real possibility of structural failure, or of the hull being lifted out of the water with catastrophic results. While there are potential technical solutions to these issues it seems that they are still some way off. So at first sight this looks like a cool idea with a somewhat limited range of application - at least for the time being.

11651,,What water is fit for cleaning hands & gear during a visit to the Great Outdoors?,stream water,"There is a far higher risk of disease from poor hygiene by those in the outdoors than the consuming stream water, let alone using it for hand and dish washing. By not using stream water directly, you introduce a level of rationing of water. This rationing is likely to encourage poor hygiene habits, and increase the risk of disease. For washing hands, if washing in clean water and soap after toileting is deemed to make you hands safe, stream water and soap will make them just as safe unless the water has exceptionally high concentrations of harmful organisms (think why do you wash you hands after toileting). Remember ""Not clean till dry and clean"", so hand washing facilities must be provided with hand drying (paper towels are best fro a large group). this applies to dishes as well. Have ample tea towels so you can always use clean dry ones (For a large group, each person should supply two - one for their personal dishes, and one to be used for cooking dishes). If you cart water in in cars, you will need 4 litres of water per person per day provided you are careful and do not waste it. You will need closer to 10 litres per person per day if you want to be certain of good hygiene practice unless the group is used to strictly rationed water. If you do want to play it safe, and do not want to cart portable water, for hand cleaning and dish washing chemical treatment is the most practical option. Filtering is effective but slow and expensive, boiling, also effective, is expensive in fuel and slow. My preferred chemical treatment is sodium hypochlorite - active ingredient in many baby bottle sterilisers.

The biggest difference is that turtles are aquatic, spending most of their time in the water, while tortoises live on land. As for your other questions: Age: It's not easy to tell the age of the snapper. They reach full size between 8 and 10 years old. Adults measure from 9.5 to 14.5 inches (24 to 36 cm), with many growing much larger. Healthy snappers live an average of 40-60 years, sometimes longer. By that criteria, the one in your pictures looks fully grown, and is probably somewhere between 10 and 60! Diet: Snappers are omnivores. About two-thirds of their diet is plant-based, including all aquatic vegetation. They also eat insects, spiders, worms, fish, frogs, grubs, smaller breeds of turtles. When bigger they eat snakes, birds, and small mammals. They're pretty sedentary, grabbing what comes by rather than hunting. Nesting habits: Size, rather than age, determines maturity. Breeding begins at about 8 inches long, usually about 6 years old. They nest between April and November. They mate in the water, then the female travels many days and more than a mile, without stopping for water, to make the nest. (Interestingly, fertilization can take place up to two years before she lays the eggs!) Nests are built on land, in loose, sandy soil, on hills, in full sun. She lays a ""clutch"" of 20-50 eggs, covers them, and makes the long journey home. If she likes the nesting spot, she'll use it for many years. It's called ""nest site fidelity."" Eggs incubate two to four months, depending mostly on the weather. Sadly, very few snapper births are successful, some sources estimate as low as 1 in 100, thus the need for the large clutch. Birds and animals eat most of the eggs. Of those that survive, few hatchlings make it to adulthood. However, large snappers have very few animal predators. Their primary predators are humans, so if they can steer clear of us, they can live a long time! Best place and time to see them: In the spring and the fall, the female is seen during the day, traveling to and from nesting areas. Unfortunately, those sightings are usually in the road, where they risk ""death-by-car""! They're hard to spot in their murky waters, but they're nocturnal, and eat after dark and early in the morning, so that's the best time to see them. Even then, they stay underwater much of the time, with just their neck and head sticking up, so look for eyes or a moving head. Tread lightly. If scared they'll go under water and swim quickly away. Conservation status: In most areas where snappers are abundant, they're not classified as ""endangered."" In Massachusetts they're ""protected."" It's illegal to hunt, capture, or remove one from its habitat. Handling is illegal too, and subject to fines, although sometimes people will do so to help them cross the road. Picking them up incorrectly is extremely dangerous to them and should always be avoided unless there's really no other choice. Special handling permits are given to certified wildlife rescuers, rehabilitators, and treatment centers. Even after dying, they're an important part of the eco-system. Removing dead body parts, including just the shells, are subject to a fine, as high as $500.00. In Massachusetts, the penalty for breeding and sales is as high as $2,000.00 (They're legal to have as pets in some states, but not in Massachusetts.) Some interesting facts: The temperature at which the eggs are maintained determines the gender. Eggs maintained at 68¬∞F produce only females; those at 70-72¬∞F produce both male and female turtles; and those incubated at 73-75¬∞F produce only males. Snapping turtles have extremely good eyesight both above and under water. They can even see straight above their heads. They also have excellent hearing. Because of their bone structure, snapping turtles can't retract their neck all the way into their body, like most other turtles can. Snappers don't bask on rocks or logs. They get the light they need by raising their head toward the sun while the body is underwater. If you think you see a ""snapping turtle"" on a log, it's probably a different, but similar-looking, turtle. Full-grown snappers are too big for most logs anyway! Snapping turtles are not as aggressive as commonly believed. They will only defend themselves if cornered, cut off from water or physically handled. They don't like confrontation, and would rather swim away than attack.

14106,,What are the pro and cons of two stage vs single stage triggers for hunting?,cost and being slightly more complex,"What the 2-stage gains you is having a perceived lighter trigger weight even though it is the same overall. I forget the technical term for it, but the first stage takes up the ""slack"" or travel in the trigger up to where you reach the second stage. From there it acts just like a single stage. So the potential benefit is if you can set the first stage high enough, you need just a little bit more squeeze to fire the trigger. For example, in your other question we assumed you had a 7-8 pound pull. With a single stage you keep squeezing until you reach that 8 pounds and BANG. With a 2-stage, you could set the first stage to say 6 or 7 pounds (depends on the springs how much adjustment you have). So now you pull back 7 pounds and you reach a stop. At that point you know it's just another pound until BANG. There isn't really much against having one other than cost and being slightly more complex.

15888,,What is this floating raft-like object in the waters of a reservoir in Massachusetts?,Loon Nesting Raft,"Just thought to expand the topic a little more. What is pictured in Sue's question is floating nest for birds. There are a number of birds that prefer the safety of raising their young away from the shore because of predators. Ideally they are not attached to land and are anchored in order to keep it that way. Although floating nest platforms are accessible to predators, a determined pair may successfully defend their young from being attacked. While some find geese to be a nuisance, others enjoy watching and feeding the birds or hunting them for sport. Since the large birds breed and raise their young near natural fresh water sources, a floating nest platform will attract more geese to your lake or pond. You can make a floating nest for geese using some common hardware items and cedar wood poles and planks. Cedar wood is preferred over other types of wood because it is naturally water resistant and doesn't contain treatment paints or chemicals that could contaminate fresh water. - How to Build a Goose Nesting Box If one desires to get fancy, here are a few examples of the luxurious models as I call them: Duck & Goose Nesting Boxes and Floating Nesting Platforms Aged Copper Roof 5' diagonal Gazebo with mother goose sitting on the nest.

Many books have this now famous way of constructing a Canada Goose Nest Platform with an anchor. I learned this one some 15 years back or so. There are various types of nesting structures that will attract Canada geese including a floating structure as described below. Cut the material as shown and nail boards onto pole sections. Attach a washtub or 10"" high section of 55 gallon drum to the platform. Drill drain holes through bottom of tub and cut an escape hatch 6"" wide and 4"" high just under the top of the tub. This is for young geese to exit the tub. Paint the tub an earth tone color and fill 1/3 full with nesting materials such as grass or hay. Anchor the platform in 2-4 ft. of water. Nesting structures should be at least 200 yards apart if they are in view of one another . This will prevent territorial conflicts. - Canada Goose Nest Platform And what about predators? Canada geese are highly adaptable and will nest in a variety of locations. In many areas, islands, muskrat houses and homemade nesting structures provide safe nest sites. Where these are not available, they will often nest in marsh vegetation, shoreline points or on upland sites where predators may find and destroy the eggs. Canada geese usually lay five or six eggs (occasionally seven). The gander does not incubate the eggs but remains close at hand guarding the female. Incubation period is 28 days, and after the young are hatched both the gander and the goose take care of them. Canada geese will aggressively defend their nest and young, often attacking intruders by striking hard blows with their wings. - Homemade Nest Sites for Giant Canada Geese",Loon Nesting Raft,0.126457453,1391,1408,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15888
16297,,What most common factors cause significant fluctuations in numbers of ticks that carry Lyme Disease?,amount of infected hosts,"The Lyme Disease is not transferred from ticks to their larvae. This is really uncommon to say the least, so most ticks are ""clean"" at ""birth"". To carry Lyme Disease, the ticks have to become infected themselves. They usually get infected by infected hosts, like mice or hedgehogs. The bacteria now reside in the tick's digestive system. Ticks now develop into small nymphs, and can start to spread the disease already. After successfully feeding again, the nymphs develop into adult ticks. Usually after infecting a host as an adult, ticks copulate on the host. The male tick dies; the female lays up to 3.000 eggs and also dies. This cycle repeats in the next spring. This entire cycle can last 3 to 6 years. -- source (in german) . This Centers for Disease Control article also explains it well in English. What we can take away from these information is that there are not too many factors that influence the population of infected ticks. One factor is obviously the amount of infected hosts, from which ticks can get the disease. One could argue that the better term would be ""availability"", since a large number of infected hosts among a larger number of ""clean"" hosts might not be beneficial at all. The availability of infected hosts, again, is somewhat dependent from the amount of infected ticks that can spread the disease. A second but less important factor is the amount of infected ticks (or larvae of nymphs) that survive from previous generations.",amount of infected hosts,0.323965043,971,995,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16297
16389,,What is the lowest altitude where the effect of lack of acclimatization can be observed?,2500 m (8000 ft),"According to the International Society for Mountain Medicine , in its article Normal Acclimitization : Acclimatization is the process of the body adjusting to the decreased availability of oxygen at high altitudes. It is a slow process, taking place over a period of days to weeks. High altitude is defined as: ‚Ä¢High Altitude: 1500 - 3500 m (5000 - 11500 ft) ‚Ä¢Very High Altitude: 3500 - 5500 m (11500 - 18000 ft) ‚Ä¢Extreme Altitude: above 5500 m Practically speaking, however, we generally don't worry much about elevations below about 2500 m (8000 ft) since altitude illness rarely occurs lower than this. If a user of this site pooh-poohs the need for acclimatization at the elevation of Denver, they should bear in mind that they are young(ish), in good shape, accustomed to sustained physical exertion and probably have often been at much higher elevations. As for peak athletic performers, according to Sports Fitness Advisor : Acclimatization to altitude has become an important part of the preparation process for athletes competing above 1500m (4921ft). This article later mentions the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City and says: It takes approximately two weeks to adapt to the changes associated with the hypobaric conditions at 2268m (7500ft), roughly that of Mexico City. Edit in Response to Comment by @Tullochgorum The OP did not ask about AMS, but about acclimatization. People in good physical shape, like most users here, will land at Denver and will not notice the effect the altitude has on them unless they have to run a goodly distance to make their connection. So they might pooh-pooh the idea of an effect in Denver. In contrast, the effect on someone in poor shape might be very noticeable (needs assistance at Denver airport, doesn't need assistance at Dulles) and a top athlete might be so attuned that he might notice any effect immediately.",2500 m (8000 ft),0.257116556,535,551,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16389

We have two types of baby carrying hiking packs, two more snuggly baby carriers, and a variety of baby wraps. The answer to your question is to carry the kid in the carrier suitable for their size and age. When your baby is brand new and can't sit up on it's own, then you should carry it in a wrap, after it gets to about 6 months old, then you can carry them in a back pack. We had our pack and a couple snuggly carriers before we got our first baby wrap. I highly recommend getting a wrap first, the babies like them much better because they keep their arms and legs tucked in and hold their heads too. They literally just sleep the whole time when they're in the wrap. When they get bigger you can move them into the backpacks. We were hiking this year with my 4 and 2 year old both in backpacks, that way my wife and I could have a good hike without having to wait for littles to keep up, or listen to them complain about being tired. But for a brand new baby, you definitely want to go with a wrap like this one: They're very versatile, they keep the baby up close to your centre of gravity, they're comfortable for you and the baby, and you can wear a backpack over top of them.

18642,,What are the steps you would go through to teach someone how to split logs?,use your palm or hammer and gently tap the axe,"This is how we teach our scouts: When cutting, your primary tool will be an axe (held with two hands) or hatchet (held with one hand), but a bow saw and splitting wedge can also be used. This focuses mainly on the former two. Safety clothing - gloves, safety goggles/glasses, and close-toed shoes (preferably boots) Safety location - choose an area safe from children and pets, lest they distract you or they get hit with wood chips. Rope or tape off an area that no one goes inside while anyone already inside has cutting tools in hand. Safety of others - be sure no one is in front of you or behind you; check often Safety in equipment - be sure axe, hatchet, and mallet or hammer heads are secure; check often. Cutting tools should be fairly sharp. Safety in technique When using an axe or hatchet, never swing at a piece of wood you are holding When using an axe, cut direction is down your center line, never have your knee or foot on that line, keep feet shoulder-width apart Never use your foot to secure a piece of wood you're cutting with axe or hatchet. A foot can secure a piece you're sawing. When using a hatchet, using two hands can make for difficult aim Never use damaged equipment Never use equipment when you are fatigued, injured, sick, or distracted Never use headphones while cutting - creates distraction, may not hear people about you Rest often All cutting should be done on a steady wood base to protect against cutting into the ground and hitting rocks or roots which can damage and dull the cutting tools, and which can reduce bounce-back if you strike it the wrong way For large pieces of wood (5"" or more, depending on your strength, stamina, wood quality, and wood type), you might have best luck starting out with a mallet and splitting wedge. If you don't have a splitting wedge, start cutting large pieces from the outside working your way inward. Lean wood against (or stand it atop) the steady wood base Avoid the temptation to use a hammer to the back of an axe or hatchet to cut. Heads can be brittle and shatter. A hammer (or rubber mallet) might be used to help dislodge a stuck head Tips with using an axe: These are heavy, and is easy to become fatigued with using one Let the axe head do the work: you don't need to put muscle into the cut, you need to put speed into the cut Minimize bending over as you cut down - that creates back aches later on (or sooner) As you lift the axe, your dominant hand holds the bottom of the axe, your other hand raises the axe by holding the handle near the axe head As the axe is lifted to its apex, slide your non-dominant hand down to above where your dominant hand is holding, and both hands should be relaxed - no death grips needed or wanted As the axe is swung down, grip firmly with both hands, just enough to control the axe on its descent, but not with a death grip: that will tend to slow the swing as well as increase fatigue Look at where you want to cut; don't take your eye off that spot as you raise the axe, or when you lower it Breathe in when you lift the axe up, breathe out when you swing down Stack cut wood periodically to avoid tripping and to make cleanup easy Tips with using a hatchet: Small pieces can pose a challenge. I've been known to bend the rules when no one's looking - we all do - but know the proper technique for securing small pieces: Method one: stand wood upright; PLACE hatchet head at top where you want to split; use your palm or hammer and gently tap the axe to start a split; when hatchet is embedded securely, swing hatchet and wood down into wood base Method two: hold wood and hatchet in one hand, and allow hatchet blade to sit on the end of the wood a few inches from the end; use the hatchet and wood like a hammer as you bang into the wood base. Holding onto the wood here is allowed, because the direction of the hatchet head isn't in the direction of your hands or fingers Note: You asked about timing. That depends on your skill, stamina, quality of tools, type of wood, condition of wood, and thickness of wood. New pieces of oak will take forever to cut through; old pine can be a breeze to go through. If you don't have a splitting wedge, that can sap time and endurance as you slog through a large piece. You asked about youngest age to cut. That depends on each child; physical capability is important, as is maturity, and each person is different. We don't teach Paul Bunyan requirements to anyone younger than 14 and all must demonstrate some degree of physical conditioning. Those who are 11 and up, and mature enough, can use a hatchet and saw under supervision.

19230,,What determines whether the young of a cat is called a kitten or a cub?,kittens,"It depends on whether the cat is a member of the Panthera (cubs) or Felinae (kittens). This Panthera is the big cats, The British taxonomist Pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the species lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard on the basis of cranial features. Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the Panthera, a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008. 4 Source and Felinae is basically everything else. A not quite complete description is that Panthera cats roar while Felinae cats purr, but that not entirely accurate as the snow leopard is unable to roar. In big cats- - lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars- - a length of tough cartilage runs up the hyoid bones to the skull. This feature prevents purring but also gives the larynx enough flexibility to produce a full- throated roar- - 114 decibels' worth in the case of one lion tested. The sound can be loud enough to be near a human's pain threshold. Purring ability, rather than size or behavior, is one of two chief distinctions between the two main genera of cat, Felis and Panthera. (The other difference is that the eyes of the former have pupils that narrow to vertical slits.) These genera are sometimes called ""the purring cats"" and ""the roaring cats,"" respectively, although among the latter only the lion roars habitually.

20189,,"What is growing in these cocoon-looking structures found on a mountain in Massachusetts, USA?",caterpillars,"We went back today and spoke with the naturalist, Cindy, who's part of a team that cares for that property which includes hundreds of acres. These are webbed nests filled with hundreds of caterpillars of the fall webworm moth, (Hyphantria cunea) . The caterpillars are tiny and hairy, and at the early stage can be any dark color. There's an outer fur that gets longer and more fluffy as the caterpillars grow. The life cycle begins when adult moths emerge from cocoons which have been in wet ground for the winter. They come out usually in June and July. The adult fall webworm is a nocturnal moth. The wings are bright white (usually with dark spots) and the wingspan is 3 to 4 cm. The body is hairy and the bases of the front legs are orange or bright yellow. Source They then lay hundreds of eggs on the underside of the leaves of their chosen tree. The egg mass of Hyphantria cunea is almost iridescent green in color. The egg batch contains 400-1000 eggs. The eggs are usually deposited on the undersides of leaves in the spring. The egg mass is lightly covered with scales from the female's abdomen. Source The eggs hatch in about a week, and the caterpillars start to eat the leaves and create webs to enclose their feeding area. They like hundreds of different tree varieties, including fruit trees when available. The tree in the picture in the question is a black cherry tree, and, as you can see, the webworms have made sure to enclose the berries into their webs. As the caterpillars (larvae) get bigger, they extend their nests. In mid-July the eggs hatch and the caterpillars begin to spin out an extensive silken web. The webworm encloses whole clusters of leaves at the ends of branches and feeds on the leaves within their tent, expanding the web downward toward the trunk and capturing more leaves as the colony expands. Source When the caterpillars are full grown, they drop out of those webs and pupate through the winter in small cocoons located in dead leaves or dark moist areas around the tree base, and emerge as new moths the following spring! Because they're woven around the foliage rather than the bark, webworm nests do not usually damage the tree branches. The foliage will regenerate as the season goes on. The tree in the picture is proof of that. Cindy said last year's nests were on the side of the tree which looks perfectly fine now. Conservation organizations, and many local arborists, do not recommend pesticides or any chemical management. The moths are important in controlling pests that are bad for other flora and fauna, and the webworms are food for many natural enemies of other pests. If you have mature webs in your yard, and don't mind the way they look, wait until they're empty and knock them down. Try not to do that until you know the caterpillars are all out. If stressed, they do a dance which indicates danger, and this may interfere with their growth or ability to survive. If you really don't like them, as many homeowners don't, try to watch for early signs of the web in the spring and knock them down while they're still small. Pick off any leaves that have started to deteriorate. That stops the spread in the tree and eliminates the worms while they're still very young.

Avalanche black spots are not really an issue on the Clova leg, Driesh, Mayar etc assuming you are taking Jock's Road but as you enter Callater section of Jock's road then you can get into some avalanche areas and the glen deepens. If you are taking the summit route then Avalanche issue only really apply on descent but the area is more prone to cornicing then avalanche in my experience. In the northern Section I would suggest Luibeg to Macdhui via Sron Riach. As a well defined ridge it is fairly clear of avalanche issues. Once on the plateau avalanches are less of an issue. Coming off the plateau and heading towards Aviemore the risk increases but if you descend via the ski area it is less of a problem and there is a cafe for coffee! In high winds you have the irony that if you take the 'safe' route through the Laraig Ghru then you have an increased risk of avalanches due to the steep sides and breaking cornices triggering avalanches if there has been sustained winds building the cornices. As with any winter walking, assess and change your route as conditions dictate. If you are walking the high ground then you may have to camp due to the lack of bothies but if you have a shovel (and I suggest you should in case of needing to build a snow hole) and can build a snow berm then your tent should be OK. I have had a tent collapse on me due to weight of snow in the Cairngorms and a Vango flysheet that broke due to getting wet then freezing when I was packing it away.

20746,,What are some common mistakes to avoid when trying winter camping for the first time?,Unfamiliarity with equipment,"Common mistakes, some of which I've made: Unfamiliarity with equipment - this isn't specific to winter camping of course, but if you've used all the gear before in milder conditions, then there's obviously less that's new to you. So if you're using a different tent to summer, make sure you've spent a night in it before the winter, so that you know where all the internal pockets are by feel, for example. Or use it in winter, but close to home/transport, so that you have an escape when you realise you're missing something vital. Equipment freezing - if you usually leave your boots in the tent porch, you might want to bring a carrier-bag to keep them warm in the tent (inside your sleeping bag in extremis!) without smearing mud everywhere. Similarly, you probably want to keep your water-bottle (and any other freezable liquids) in your inner tent. Cooking fuel - you'll need up to twice as much fuel as summer - even more if you need to melt snow or ice to obtain drinking/cooking water. Make sure you take plenty; it's pretty miserable in winter without hot food. If you're using gas, avoid butane (which completely liquefies at around -0.5¬∞C, depending on altitude) - butane/propane mix is a better choice (down to around -15¬∞C/+5¬∞F or so). You might need to keep your fuel inside your tent, or even your sleeping bag - but only if you're confident it won't leak; going hungry is preferable to being poisoned! Whatever fuel you use, make sure you know how it behaves at the temperatures you might encounter, and insulate it appropriately. Food - as for cooking, you'll need more body-fuel to maintain your warmth and to carry the heavier load than summer. If you've done a lot of winter day-trips, you'll be used to taking a bit extra in your pockets, but might not realise how much more you're eating when off the hill. On a backpacking trip, you can't afford to get into energy debt. Snow - depending on your tent design, snow may settle on it, and cause the outer to touch the inner; in very heavy, wet, snow, it could even collapse your tent. In such conditions, you might need to get up every few hours to clear it. Snow can also reduce ventilation under the flysheet, leading to problems with condensation, and (at least theoretically) with CO‚ÇÇ build-up. Ground conditions - frozen ground can be hard to get pegs into, or deep snow might require broad pegs (""sand pegs"") if you can't clear it to ground level. Make sure you know what kind of ground to expect, or take a selection of pegs for different conditions. Use a sleeping mat; in cold conditions, I've even used an ordinary closed-cell mat underneath the tray groundsheet and an inflatable pad inside the tent. Daylight - depending on your latitude, days may be much shorter than they are in summer, so you'll have less time to reach your destination, or will have to make camp by torchlight.

873,,What are some ways/devices that I can use to charge my batteries in the wilderness?,"in your arm-pit, or in a hot cup of coffee","Perhaps the most obvious and commercially available is solar , which has options ranging from small pocket-sized chargers to roll-out military grade flexible panels. I believe Brunton makes a consumer grade version of the latter (not as bullet-proof), and iGo has some nice versions of the former. I have used both with some success, the panel is probably over-kill if you are just looking to charge a few AAs (we were charging GPS dataloggers and hand-held computers). However, the small ones are not something I would depend upon, tending to charge slowly. Both require (of course) sunlight. The second option is to carry more batteries -- either another set or two of fully charged batteries in the size you need, or if you have a variety of other electronics to charge, an old-school camcorder battery can be used to re-charge smaller batteries. Some companies make recharge-able power-packs geared toward cell-phones which function the same way. However, for anything critical (emergency devices) I would highly recommend ALWAYS packing a set of fresh, regular batteries that you can slip in when your re-charge options fail. Digression 1: I've often thought a little hydro-generator would be slick if you are camping near a creek - plop it in the current and charge overnight... but have yet to find one (or hear of a do-it-yourself) that is practical. Digression 2: While poking around for the hydro-power, I found this wind turbine which looks like a fun project... and possible could (should) be modified for water-born deployment. Water always flows. BONUS PRO-TIP : On cold mornings, gently warming a dying battery (ie in your arm-pit, or in a hot cup of coffee) can sometimes get the reaction going just enough to generate a last gasp of energy. Highly NOT recommended as standard practice due to explosion concerns, but in a life-or-death emergency, it might give you enough juice to make that critical radio call.","in your arm-pit, or in a hot cup of coffee",0.143949613,1630,1672,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/873
1171,,What is the best way to break up a fight among dogs on a sled line?,separating the fighters,"Since answers are not forthcoming - I'll share what I have learned works, but I'm still hoping someone has some better ideas: Since dog fights are not the result of some deep-seated impassioned hatred for one another (dogs don't carry a grudge) separating the fighters is usually enough to break up the fight. They quickly forget what they were fighting about and move on. Distraction A loud noise, such as the snap of belt against the sled, or a loud whistle can sometimes startle and distract fighting dogs momentarily, allowing you to pull one away from the other. Dragging Grabbing a dog by its hind legs and pulling it away from the other dog can confuse it enough that it lets go. It might instinctively whip around to check you out, but assuming you have worked with these dogs, and they respect you, a quick ""Hey!"" will let it know who you are, and it won't bite you. Controlled Pressure Using your foot to press down on one dog's neck and pin it to the snow while pulling the other up by the collar (lifting its front legs off the ground) is a way to regain control without injuring the dogs. This would be akin to your father putting his stern hand on your shoulder and pressing you down to get you under control as a child. NEVER kick a dog This all assumes these dogs know you - and know you to be the benevolent dictator of the pack. Dogs run best if they respect their handler as the Alpha of the pack - not because they fear their handler. Thus there is no excuse for violence, beating, kicking or otherwise harming a dog. Of course, prevention is the best course (keeping dominant males separate, correct placement of females in heat) but that is a topic for a different question.",separating the fighters,0.468910873,245,268,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1171
1497,,What can an injured person in the outdoors do to prevent infection by flesh-eating bacteria?,good hand washing,"The National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation says : Preventive Measures First, let it be said that there is no sure prevention. Necrotizing fasciitis has been known to be spontaneous. A bruise or abrasion are all the ""opening"" in the skin necessary for bacteria to enter. However, there are some things you can do decrease risk. The single biggest preventative measure is keeping the skin intact! Next is cleanliness. Always wash even the smallest opening in the skin and apply an antibiotic ointment. Buy tubes of antibiotic ointment and keep one in your car, your desk, your exercise bag, and at home. Take care with your children, impressing upon them the importance of cleanliness. Be respectful to protect others from infection if you suspect that you may have a Strep infection, such as Strep throat, or have been exposed to someone with a known Strep infection. Symptoms do not have to be present for a person to be carrying the bacteria and infect others. One case of infection that comes to mind is a health care worker with two children at home with Strep throat. She had no symptoms, but innocently infected three people, one of whom died. These simple measures are the most protection one can give oneself against any infection. It just can't be stressed enough, however, that a pin prick (one woman became infected at the point of entry from a blood draw) can be the opening it takes. (This is not an endorsement for the entity known as The National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation.) The CDC says : The spread of all types of GAS infection can be reduced by good hand washing, especially after coughing and sneezing and before preparing foods or eating. Persons with sore throats should be seen by a doctor who can perform tests to find out whether the illness is strep throat. If the test result shows strep throat, the person should stay home from work, school, or day care until 24 hours after taking an antibiotic. All wounds should be kept clean and watched for possible signs of infection such as redness, swelling, drainage, and pain at the wound site. A person with signs of an infected wound, especially if fever occurs, should immediately seek medical care. It is not necessary for all persons exposed to someone with an invasive group A strep infection (i.e. necrotizing fasciitis or strep toxic shock syndrome) to receive antibiotic therapy to prevent infection. However, in certain circumstances, antibiotic therapy may be appropriate. That decision should be made after consulting with your doctor. According to this LA Times article Aimee Copeland's infection was apparently caused by Aeromonas hydrophila which is a less common agent in necrotizing fasciitis: Necrotizing fasciitis is typically caused by an especially aggressive form of Group A Streptococcus, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. But not always. Copeland's father, Andy Copeland, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that Aeromonas hydrophila caused his daughter's rare bacterial infection. The article states, quoting microbiologist Amy Horneman: Infections caused by the bacterium are relatively easy to treat with common antibiotics -- but only if recognized in time. ""There are certain drugs that just don't work,"" she said. ""The best drugs to use are Ciprofloxacin and Bactrim (also SXT, Septra)."" Naturally occurring in water sources throughout the world, Aeromonas hydrophila bacterium has many positive contributions to the eco-system, she said. ... ""When I heard about the case, and I heard she fell in the water and got a deep cut... I thought, 'It must be Aeromonas hydrophila,'"" Horneman said. ... ""I am not an alarmist,"" she said, noting that she raised two sons and allowed them to participate in water-related sports and activities. ""But I am very aggressive about treating any kind of cut, any kind of wound infection."" She advises the public to seek medical attention for such wounds, but again stressed: ""Not all wounds become necrotizing fasciitis."" From this one might conclude that all injuries exposed to river water should receive special attention, perhaps even antibiotics.",good hand washing,0.336419374,1573,1590,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1497
4109,,What to do with the lap coiled rope if the belayer wishes to lead consecutive pitches?,recoiling,"The best way, when it works It usually works to grab the whole mass of coils, and flip them over when handing them to the second. When you're doing this, care has to be taken that you don't wrap one of the ends around one of the climber's anchor cord. The leader (when bringing up the second) has to make sure that the loops are neatly and tightly stacked, and not falling over. Also, as you're coiling: The general advice is to start with large loops, and progress to smaller ones as the second gets closer to the belay. That way the loops don't interfere with each other as you belay from that coil. With this setup, you want to do the opposite - start with smaller / medium sized loops, and progress to larger ones. That way when you flip it, the larger loops are on the bottom. But this whole thing is more art than science, and I'd recommend you try and practice it safely on the ground (maybe in your living room) a few times to get the hang of it. If the loops aren't laying neatly, this technique probably won't work, and will result in a big knot. Also, you have to make sure that the person leading the next pitch (or their end of the rope) isn't somehow tangled as you pass the coils over. The slower, more predictable option You also have the option of recoiling the rope manually, passing it foot-by-foot from the leader to the belayer. This is going to be slower, but has a lower chance of getting tangled. If you think the lap coils aren't as neat as you'd like, or your belayer is inexperienced, and may have trouble managing the coils while belaying, I'd go with this route.",recoiling,0.2650657,1265,1274,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4109
5174,,What are the consequences of ‚Äî illegally ‚Äî using a 446 MHz PMR in the North American wilderness?,It may also be illegal to market such a radio in some countries,"In both the U.S. and Canada, amateur radio operators serve an important role in providing emergency radio communications during war, disaster, terrorist attack, or whatever other emergency. So amateur radio operators take an extremely dim view of unlicensed operators using frequencies allocated to amateur (or sometimes commercial) radio. Many will even hunt down unlicensed transmitters and report them to authorities. Radio Amateurs of Canada says that fines can ""run to hundreds of dollars,"" but in the U.S., fines start at $10,000 and go up dramatically from there. In the U.S., 446 MHz is used nationwide as a simplex calling frequency , so if you are transmitting on PMR 446 channel 1 at 446.00625 MHz, you almost certainly will be noticed, and you probably will be noticed on any other channel. This frequency is also in the band plan in Canada for the same purpose. If you can avoid doing so, it's a good idea to not use amateur radio frequencies without being licensed. It's not terribly difficult or expensive to become licensed, so it's an option worth looking into. Even so, in this band in both the U.S. and Canada amateur radio operators are secondary users of the band and must yield to primary users, such as...the U.S. military. If you are close enough to a PAVE PAWS military radar , your PMR446 transmission also may interfere with it, since it uses the same frequency band. In your proposed travel, the nearest such installation is at the Clear Air Force Station in Denali, Alaska. You do not want to mess with the US Department of Defense's ability to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles. My recommendation would be to replace the radios with FRS/GMRS radios and to keep the PMR446 radios, in case you ever return to Europe. (Note that GMRS does not require a license in Canada, but it does in the United States.) MURS , which has been available in the U.S. for several years, was supposed to be introduced in Canada in 2014, but this has been deferred indefinitely . It has higher transmitter power limits (2 watts) and, interestingly, far fewer users, at least in the U.S. When these radios eventually do become available in Canada, this may make a good alternative to FRS/GMRS if you need longer range or signal quality. Interestingly, while searching the Internet in relation to this question, I learned that some radio baseband processors can handle FRS, GMRS, MURS and PMR446 on the same chip , so in principle a switchable radio could be built that would operate on FRS/GMRS or MURS in North America and PMR446 in Europe, but I was not able to find any such radio on the market. Such radios might appear on the market in the next few years, or I might need to search more thoroughly. It may also be illegal to market such a radio in some countries. Along the same lines, many mass-market PMR446 radios have a nearly identical version with the same model number which is programmed for FRS/GMRS instead, so if you are happy with your existing radios, you can buy (nearly) identical ones that use FRS/GMRS. Another option is to purchase a programmable radio, and program in the correct frequencies corresponding to FRS, GMRS, MURS or PMR446, depending on where you will use it. The two main problems with this approach are also legal: Such radios are usually certified as business radios and thus may not be entirely legal to operate unlicensed, and their power output may also be higher than is allowed for unlicensed operation on these frequencies. One popular example of such a radio is the Baofeng UV-5R . In its low power mode it still transmits at 1 watt, higher than the maximum 500 mW allowed for FRS. It's less likely that you will be caught for this, but it is still possible.",It may also be illegal to market such a radio in some countries,0.106629066,2720,2783,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5174

Consider another clean plate over them to keep them clean no shoes in the tent ever. Take them off while your body is in the tent but your feet are still out, and keep them in the vestibule. Put them on in reverse put a lifejacket or other non-fuzzy item down in the vestibule to put non-shoe things on, out of the sand bring a small hand whisk to keep the tent swept out and use it at every takedown, plus daily if you stay in one spot if your knees or backside are sandy, get them brushed off before you get in the tent. Use your dry hands, or the tent whisk, to get the worst off while you're still outside - ideally, step a few feet away from the tent while you do so buy replacement sliders for your tent zippers and keep them permanently in a tent pocket or your repair kit. Sand abrades the inside of zipper sliders and keeps the zipper from closing. Replacing them is a matter of minutes and presto - your zipper closes again hang things up even if they aren't wet, to keep them out of the sand or to give sand a chance to fall / blow out of them. To that end, get several clotheslines up pretty much as soon as you've set up camp, and always bring a dozen clothespegs with you (I keep mine in the rope bag) work out a way to get from your sand-rinsing place to the tent without picking up more sand.

What you're seeing is not a fluke. It's happening in many urban areas in India, and is a serious problem. Although many studies have been done over the years, the largest group in your area which is currently involved in the study and preservation of sparrows is The Nature Forever Society . Since 2005, they've been working for the conservation of house sparrows and other common flora and fauna in urban habitats. Their mission is to involve the citizens in the conservation movement of India, especially in urban landscapes. I recommend spending a lot of time on their website. There's a tremendous amount to learn, and things you can do to become involved. For instance, each year on March 20, they sponsor World Sparrow Day . They also give out Sparrow Awards to regular citizens who are making a real impact in the lives of sparrows. Their research is the focus of an article published in March of 2016 in the Daily News Analysis, entitled 10 reasons why the sparrow is fast disappearing from Mumbai . In the words of the author Shraddha Shirodkar: While no one can be singled out for the declining sparrow population, it is humans who are collectively responsible for it, explains Mohammed Dilawar, President, Nature Forever Society (NFS), a crusader for the sparrow as well as other common flora and fauna in urban habitats. Through his non-governmental, non-profit organisation, he has been championing the cause of sparrows, by involving citizens in the conservation movement, especially in urban areas. She compiled a list called ""10 reasons why Mumbaikars need to save the sparrow"". I removed the tenth because I found conflicting evidence from other sources. The bullet points are hers, but also include information from other sources that said the same thing. Felling of trees It is common knowledge that more the number of trees, more the number of birds. The spike in the felling of trees in Mumbai is a major reason why sparrows and other birds are facing a loss of habitat, especially their natural nesting spots. Lack of cavity nesting The ubiquitous glass buildings of Mumbai‚Äîthe corporate dens‚Äîhave replaced many older structures that were built with a fa√ßade that had nooks and crannies, even bricked roofs, which allow sparrows to nest. Absence of native plants Native plants such as adulsa, mehndi and many others are outdone by fancy non-native ones like Duranta Erecta, Dumb Cane and others as the trend of modern landscaping catches on. Native plants are the natural habitats of sparrows, providing them insects such as aphids to feed on. Sparrows need a diet of insects in their formative years to grow into healthy adults. Absence of hedgerows Contemporary landscaping is also doing away with hedges, which are preferred by sparrows for nesting. Thick hedgerows are known to protect nesting birds such as the sparrow from predation. Widespread use of concrete Sparrows are known to take two types of bath‚Äîone with water and one with dust. With the extensive use of concrete in Mumbai, the species is unable to take dust baths. Modern grocery storage Sparrows are known to feed on tiny grains like bajra, which used to be freely available from pecking at gunny bags stored outside older-style grocery stores. They were able to spill seeds on the ground. Also, grocers and street vendors purposely dropped grain and seeds to encourage the sparrows. Modern grocery stores with air-conditioning and plastic packaging take away any chance of finding food grains to feed on. Chemical fertilisers in agricultural produce Heavy use of chemical fertilisers leads to agricultural produce being laced by them, hence ruining the food of sparrows. Cell phone radiation The electromagnetic fields and radiation created by mobile towers are known to affect sparrows. The effects range from damage to the immune and nervous system of sparrows to interference with their navigating sensors. They tend to get confused and leave the area within a week. Since the eggs they've laid nearby need two weeks to incubate, they don't end up hatching. (I found this in many publications, as it's a very common theory at the moment.) High litter index in Mumbai There is a rise in the population of crows and stray cats due to the high litter index in Mumbai. Simply put, more the garbage, more the predators that prey on sparrows.

Dr. Wilkerson also notes that many non-hypertensive individuals experience the opposite effect, that is, an increase in blood pressure when exposed to high altitudes."" Also, the Institute for Altitude Medicine state that ""Some persons with HBP, however, develop lower blood pressure on ascent to high altitude."" Response In the November 2009 issue of the ""Journal of Travel Medicine,"" Dr. Timothy O‚ÄôBrien and colleagues reported on a study that found a group of black mountaineers experienced a drop in their systolic blood pressure numbers as they climbed to high altitude . Systolic pressure is the amount of force placed against the body‚Äôs arterial walls when the heart contracts. It is designated by the top number in a blood pressure reading. However, the systolic pressure of white mountain climbers increased as they ascended. The cause of the racial differences is unknown and may not apply to all individuals. The authors speculated that the observed differences seen in this small study may have been due to differences in genetics, hypoxic stress, diet and exercise.

Yes. Any source of water - no matter how large or small - should be avoided when choosing a camp site. 100 meters is just a guideline, 200 meters is better. 200 meters and out of sight is great. The reasons are several-fold: Waste - wastewater should never be put in creeks/lakes/etc - and although many people will walk 200 meters away to dispose of it properly, most wont. The closer people are to a body of water, the more likely they are to say ""ah to heck with it"" and dump it in. It's difficult to resist the temptation to just do a quick rinse of hands, plates, etc in a creek that is right next to you. Erosion - The riparian areas next to creeks and lakes are often the most sensitive, and can not handle large amounts of traffic. Traffic up and down and along the creek banks can cause rapid erosion of soil and cause vegetation loss. This is a problem from alpine to canyon ecosystems.

A smooth bore firearm is simply never going to demonstrate the same level of accuracy as a rifle and will never excel at distances much past 100 yards with 75 yards and closer being the weapon‚Äôs ideal zone. Extolling the virtues of the smooth bore slug gun Slugs are better now. To 75 yards they have become extremely accurate. My current favorite is Brenneke's K.O. , which has an attached plastic wad that works like the tail of a badminton bird to keep the the slug flying straight. Stores around here stock huge piles of K.O.s prior to deer season and sell them for very little. At 75 yards they will shoot 1 ¬Ω"" to 2"" groups all day, which was unheard of when I started deer hunting. At 100 yards they usually print 3""-4"" groups but the K.O., like any smoothbore slug, often loses stability somewhere between 75 and 100 yards and one may tumble far off target. Smoothbore Shotgun Slugs: Then and Now A smoothbore ""slug gun"" with rifle sights will usually shoot groups in the 3"" (6 MOA) range at 50 yards/meters, making them satisfactory deer hunting weapons at short range. An occasional example will do better, and some do worse. Their effective deer hunting range is limted by their accuracy, but the slug itself is dangerous to other hunters at far greater distances, an important point to keep in mind. Shotgun Slugs Shotguns aren't usually used for their accuracy, but at the same time whitetail deer (probably the most common application for slugs) have a kill zone 10 inches in diameter , so you should be fine with a shotgun out to 100 yards with 6 MOA (which of course will depend on your gun and the conditions).",6 MOA,0.861905932,1723,1728,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11799

19208,,What is the proper way to ford a shallow body of water in a back country situation?,preexisting track,"I will answer in reverse order: (2) the least impact to the stream ecosystem, presuming you intend to cross, is to use the preexisting track. First, this restricts disturbance to an already disturbed place (kind of like walking on the trail, not next to it). Second, you aren't going to need to break ground to another part of the stream, again limiting new disturbance. (But, did that track heading off just a bit back there lead to a bridge or safer place? Check the map.) (1) Safety. Since somebody else managed to get across, it is conceivable that you can too (avoid places where tracks go in but none come out!). But, conceivable is not a clear yes. You need to determine for yourself if it is safe for you to cross now , as opposed to them back when . So: What is the current water depth, do you need a snorkel (and have one)? What is the bottom like (rock, gravel, sand, mud, big holes), and is it possible that it has changed since the last crossing, such as being washed out in a flash flood? What do the entry and exit look like, and do you have approach and takeoff angles that can handle it (and don't forget how deep the hood might go in the water on a steep entry)? How do you rate your abilities (previous experience), your group's abilities (if multiple vehicles), and your rescue gear (winch, traction devices, mechanical knowledge and tools if you stall out the engine with water)? Did you actually walk the proposed crossing to check it out? If all else fails, how close to civilization are you, and how good are your communications (cell, radio, PLB)? You did leave a proposed itinerary and return time with someone back in civilization, didn't you? ""Is it safe?"" is ultimately about risk assessment giving the whole system a good look. If you are alone, and it was deep when you walked it, and has tree snags, and you are out in a vehicle you borrowed from a friend without any equipment, there is no shame in turning back and leaving it for another day. There is no shame in turning back in a well-equipped group if it just doesn't seem like a good risk.

20084,,What is the best practice to secure a 17ft open canoe to the roof of a vehicle?,if you have roof racks,"More canoes are destroyed by flying off a car than are wrapped around rocks. (Western Canoe Company factoid) Best is if you have roof racks. A: Secure mid point of the canoe to the back of the roof. B: Secure the stern of the canoe to the rear bumper, preferable as close to the corners as possible. C: Secure the other end of the canoe to the front bumper. More detail: Rope Don't cheap out. Use nylon rope. It has a bit of stretch to it so that it doesn't go from tight to floppy with the relaxation of 2 mm. 1/4"" (6 mm) or 5/16"" (7.5mm) is sufficient. It can be twisted or braided. Polyester rope has very little stretch. Sisal and manilla rope change dimensions if they get wet. Ratchet straps These work well too. If you have long lengths of ratchet strap in the wind, they vibrate like crazy. Put about 1 half twist to 1-2 feet to reduce the vibration if you find it annoying. Ratchet strap hooks aren't as flexible for attaching to either the canoe or the car. In some cases you can use a rope loop at one or both ends. I don't like the camlock straps. I've had those loosen up on me on several occasions. I have more rope than ratchets, so the rest of these instructions deal with rope. Adapt to your situation. Midpoint With roofrack Run a line with several turns around the crossbar, using a knot like a pipe hitch, double catspaw, or prussik. The idea is you don't want the rope to slide on the cross bar. Wrapping the bar with wrinkly duct tape or hockey tape may make this easier. Repeat on other side. At this point you have two ropes attached to the roof rack crossbar in a way they can't slide. One rope should be short enough to not reach all the way across the canoe. Put a bowline in the end. Run the other rope through the bowline, pull hard and tie. Repeat the above steps for the other cross bar. No roof rack. You need to keep the gunwales from scratching your roof. Canoe stores sell foam blocks for this. You can also take a pool noodle, cut into 1 foot chunks, slit one side to the hole in the middle, and clip this around the gunwale. I have also used life jackets. PITA. Open the car doors. Run a loop of rope through the body of the car and over the roof. Put two loops that are the width of the canoe apart, (A figure 8 knot tied on a bight works well) OR tie a series of knots (figure 8) a few cm apart so that there are knots around the gunwales when you put the canoe on top. Tie this rope loop firmly. (Same technique as above, put a loop in one end, run the other end through, pull and secure.) Now you have a rope with a high traction surface. Treat the rope like you did the cross bars, and tie to it. Having knots in the rope on either side of the door opening so that the whole loop cannot shift once the door is closed is a good idea. Stern. Secure to the car's corners. Some cars don't really have a bumper. You may need to go underneath and secure to the frame. If you will be doing this a lot, you may want to add tie down eyes on whatever you do have at the corners. Do not tighten this yet. Get snug though. Bow The wind force on the canoe is going to try to push the canoe back. If the bow is in front of the bumper, then, if you tie to the bow, you just pull back more. Canoe slides, and ropes go slack. Instead use the bow seat as your tie point. Tie to a corner of the car, take a turn around the seat, go over the canoe, take a turn around the seat on the other side, and down to the corner. The idea is that the turns around the seat keep the the rope from sliding forward, and the loop over the bottom of the canoe takes most of the strain off the seat. If the bumper is unusable, open the hood (bonnet) secure lines to some part of the frame, and run out under the sides. There is going to be strong forces on these lines. Take care that you don't damage your car. The hood is latched only at the centre. You want to run the ropes in a way that doesn't pull up on the corners. Adjustments. At this point the front ropes are vertical or sloped back toward your windshield. If they are sloping forward, you need to move the whole canoe back on your car. Tighten the ropes. Roof, bow, stern. If you are using foam blocks or noodles, you want to see them squish. If using a roof rack, pluck the ropes. Play music on them. Often once you get going, things loosen up. Drive 10 km, and stop and check. Cautions I've had canoes turn on my roof, due to the canoe sliding back, and loosening the front lines. This will put a substantial sideways force on the car. If it happens rapidly, you may have an interesting time. The smaller your car, the stronger the effect. I had a canoe try to escape when the front line broke (sharp frame) Stop and check at 10 km, 30 km, and every time you stop for to 'rest' and buy petrol. In passing, I'm impressed with a 4 day workshop that can produce a 22 kg 17 foot canoe. This sounds fragile. That's a light canoe even made from modern composites.

21368,,What are the differences between a lighthouse and a light station in terms of the specific purpose?,the entire grounds and complex around a light,"First, I would like to give a definition of a smaller term, that of just ""light."" For this, I turn to the U.S. Coast Guard. In this brief PDF of the Aids to Navigation System , we get a couple helpful quotes right on the first page: These aids may be anything from lighthouses, to minor lights , daybeacons, range lights , and sound signals, to lighted or unlighted buoys. ( emphasis added ) and: Beacons are aids to navigation structures that are permanently fixed to the earth‚Äôs surface. They range from lighthouses to small, single-pile structures and may be located on land or in the water. Lighted beacons are called lights ; unlighted beacons are called daybeacons. ( emphasis added ) Thus The actual signal device is called simply a light. The light can be affixed to a house, or more likely within a tower or cupola added to a house, which we then call a lighthouse. More often today, however, lights are put on antenna-like structures. Where there are such lights, they tend to get unofficial names from the local boating public. For example, although you won't find it on any chart nor any official publication, but the light that marks a certain bend in the Ohio River (near my former home) is the Dayton Light. It is somewhat near Dayton, KY, but on the Ohio side, and not directly across from Dayton. But everyone calls it Dayton Light. As for Light Station, I do not at all doubt either Wikipedia nor Charlie in the prior answer, that this term describes the entire grounds and complex around a light. However, I usually associate this term with some degree of official-dom, such as the Coast Guard or one of its predecessors like the Life Saving Service or Revenue Cutter Service. I had a harder time finding references for this. The closest I could come is a list from the U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office. (If you expand the ""R"" Race Point is listed.) Since most lights have been automated, few if any of these Light Stations remain active, so the Historian links to the National Park Service for those that have been preserved as landmarks. That link is dead, but I did find some additional information doing a search on NPS's site.

681,,"What are areas of the body which lose heat more quickly, and how can I reduce that loss?",The skull The groin The armpits,"My original answer to this question sparked a surprisingly intense debate, so I'm rewriting it to clarify a few points and offer a more holistic answer. Let me start by saying that every square inch of skin on the human body is capable of allowing heat to escape. That is to say, if you wear a jacket with no pants, your legs will lose more heat than your torso -- but if you wear pants with no jacket, your torso will lose more heat than your legs. Both areas are capable of losing heat -- and will do so more quickly when exposed. Therefore, any part of your body that's more exposed to the cold than another part has the potential to lose more heat than other than parts that are less exposed. This is fairly obvious, but I mention it for completeness' sake. This generally means that you should try to cover yourself as much as possible, especially larger skin surfaces like the torso. However, the point that I think the OP is trying to get at is that -- all else being equal -- every square inch of exposed human skin does NOT lose heat at the same rate . That is to say, some areas of skin lose heat faster than others. If you were to stand in the cold totally naked, some parts of you would lose heat more quickly than others. This is an indisputable, biological fact. Allow me to explain: Human blood serves many functions -- one of which is thermoregulation . As an evolutionary adaption, humans have areas on their body that are especially suited for releasing heat, in order to cool us off when we get too hot. In these areas, there is a high volume of blood flow, and that blood passes very close to the skin. These areas are: The skull The groin The armpits Some might also say the extremities, like fingers and toes. In these areas, there is a lot of blood flowing around, and the skin is fairly thin, allowing heat to escape from the blood more quickly than in other areas. Therefore, if you are in a desperate survival situation where you risk hypothermia, these are the areas of the body you should focus on keeping the warmest. Armpits are fairly easy to keep warm, just keep your elbows down and they'll be insulated by your torso and upper arm. It's important to keep warm, dry underwear in order to keep your groin warm as well. And yes, YOU SHOULD WEAR A HAT. While you might not lose the ""majority"" of body heat through your head, it is one of the areas of skin that loses heat most quickly and it should be one of the main things you focus on keeping warm. The extremities are also important to keep warm. I have friends that go out jogging in the winter wearing shorts and a t-shirt. They don a warm beanie and gloves right before they go out, and those are all it takes to keep them warm in freezing temperatures. In summary: If you have clothes or ways to protect every inch of skin on your body, you should do that. I thought this was basic common sense, but people were squabbling so I'll reiterate. However, if you only have limited means of protection and you need to focus on warming only a small area of your body, you're best off focusing on the four areas listed above.",The skull The groin The armpits,0.280871511,1640,1671,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/681

That said, you could easily go three ways with the choice of vehicle: AWD, little clearance -- Something like a Subaru will get you to almost all the trailheads that are open almost all the time. You might occasionally have to pick a different trailhead, but most of the time it'll be just fine. (This is what lots of people would recommend, with good reason.) 4x4, high clearence -- An Xterra or similar small suv on a truck frame, will get you to basically every trailhead at any time. I personally wouldn't go this route in the Boulder area, because I feel like it's totally overkill. You won't every have to pick a different trailhead, but the extra gas money and higher purchase price isn't worth it in my mind. little car -- Something like a civic will get you to a (not maybe the one you want) trailhead anytime you want.

10635,,What coat should I wear when camping that won't be damaged through melting by embers from a fire?,wool jacket,"Wool does not melt or drip This answer might surprise you: wool ! Wool (...) does not melt or drip(.) Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers. It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip; it forms a char which is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets. From section "" characteristics "" It's even quite commonly used a so called ""fire-retardant material"" in many end consumer textile products. Check out a list here . Here's another interesting article regarding this topic: According to Wool Gatherer, one thing that makes carded wool flame resistant is the fact that the fibers are so close together that they create an environment that is fairly devoid of oxygen thus resisting flame. An example of this idea, although one I have not personally tried and would not recommend, would be attempting to light a phonebook on fire. Apparently, it is not easy to light a phonebook on fire, as the pages are so tightly held together there is not enough oxygen present to support the flame. Last but not least you may want to watch a comparison between synthetic products and wool here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKuAl_HzCjs Product recommendation As a product recommendation I can refer to this one (however, it has some cotton on the inside , the shell/outside is completely made out of wool): This coat originated in the 1800s and is still as popular today. The rugged wool-blend shell wards off the fiercest weather. It's not only warm, but it sheds water, and the tight weave keeps out bone-chilling wind. Two-piece sleeve for a roomier fit; knit storm cuffs in sleeves. Four outer snap pockets, plus hand-warmer pockets and internal security pocket.

14512,,"What is the correct technique for self arrest, with an ice axe, on a snow or ice slope?",braking efficiency,"The most important thing to remember is to prevent this situation. You should never find yourself in the position to slip down a slope. In many cases (steepness, snow/ice conditions, ...) there is no way that you will stop once you are slipping, even if you execute the following perfectly. Still we want to be prepared for the worst case as well. And knowing the following is just a first and minor step, the most important thing is to actually try it over and over again. Just make sure the terrain is suitable, so no rocks and a flat (snow) section at the bottom. There are two phases: First you need to get yourself in a stable position, then you need to brake until you eventually stop. The techniques vary depending on the equipment: With an ice-axe and crampons, with an ice-axe only or with neither. Stable position The final position you want to be in is front to the ground and head up-slope (against the direction of slipping). Details vary depending on equipment. Ice-axe and crampons Basically the same as with just an ice-axe, however you must make sure your feet are off the ground at all times. Your crampons catching potentially results in uncontrolled tumbling and serious injury. Ice-axe Turn sideways, if on your back. Plunge the pick of your ice-axe into the snow. Do it gradually and keep a firm grip. If you do lose the axe, proceed as described below. This will automatically turn you in the head up position. Neither Essentially the same again, but instead of plunging the pick into the snow you brake by pushing your arms into the snow. Just try to lift your upper body with the arms, as if you were going into a plank position or doing push-ups. Braking Ice-axe and crampons Still keep your feet away from the ground. If the terrain permits it, keep that way till you stop; it's the safest. If the terrain becomes rocky, try to brake without your feet until there is no other option any more. Meaning the risk to get into an uncontrolled tumble is negligible, as falling over a ridge/crashing into rocks/... is imminent and worse. Ice-axe Hold one hand on the shaft, the other on the head of the ice-axe and position it in front of your chest. Apply pressure by leaning onto it. Again do this gradually, sticking it into hard packed snow will probably yank it out of your hands. This position might be scary as the ice-axe is pretty close to your face. True, this is dangerous, but this is a life-threatening situation, so braking efficiency wins over the potentially broken nose or missing tooth. Neither Get up onto your underarms, then lift all your body so that only the underarms and feet are in contact with the snow. In certain conditions you might even want to get into a push-up position (only hands and feet on the ground).",braking efficiency,0.265982687,2450,2468,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14512

15024,,What are the measurable prerequisites of strength and/or flexiblity for starting to climb in a climbing gym?,endurance,"No, there are no particular prerequisites for indoor climbing. Strength, flexibility, endurance will come along the way. Just take a look into any gym, you will see small, large, fat, weak people. In my place there regularly is a one-armed guy... The gym Look for a large, well-run, popular gym. Good signs are: A nice, inviting website which shows all rooms/walls of the gym; explains how everything functions; explains any rules. Beginner and advanced courses. Being chock full at prime time. There should be a small gym-inside-the-gym with assorted equipment (boards to hang from, maybe some weight training stuff). I would strongly suggest taking a beginners course. Those are available for adults. While it may feel weird, just shrug off the feeling. Do not be shy, talk to the coach, ask questions, actually do what she says, and so on. A partner But the main reason for taking a beginners course would be to find another beginner to start your journey with! Exchange phone numbers with someone who seems to be close to your level of body strength, fitness, etc.. Find a weekly ""jour fixe"" where you regularly meet. The time/day-of-the-week of the course is a good starting point, as both of you obviously had spare time right then! Then just go and climb. You will find that you will improve very quickly. Do not be shy watching better climbers (i.e., everybody else). Nobody will think bad about you; most people will remember how it was when they started. The partner is important because a) motivation and b) talking about how to tackle different problems. As both of you will have different arm/leg lengths, mobilities, etc., you will quickly see that you will take different approaches to climbing, so you will learn from each other, even if you both are beginners. Bouldering I tried to get into indoor top-rope climbing twice, and it did not work out. The problem is that you are absolutely tied (sic) to having a partner around (so no spontaneous night at the gym) and downtime is much worse. One of you is always not climbing; and when the gym is full, the fullness is much worse, so to speak, since each climb takes longer. Also, frankly, I had incidents with lazy/inattentive partners while my life was literally hanging from a thread... Bouldering to the rescue! I encourage you to skip all the complexities of top-rope climbing, and go straight to bouldering, if you have a gym that focuses on that. Bouldering might not look like much, but it is very intense, and since you do not have a long climb for every route, it is much easier for the route setters to give you many, many more diverse problems. If a bouldering hall is full, it's not such a big problem. You get queues in front of the walls, but since each attempt takes only a few dozen seconds, 1-2 minutes max, you get to climb rather sooner than later. Also, when the difficulty rises, you need the time between tries to recover your strength anyways, so it is actually good to see what others are doing at ""your"" problem.",endurance,0.502677143,86,95,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15024
15628,,"What is this animal with orange webbed feet, a white head with black stripes, and really likes breadcrumbs?",bar-headed geese,"I believe this is a bar-headed goose . Source Source The Bar-headed Goose has a white head with distinctive black bars or stripes on its head, black extending down the front and back of the neck, leaving a white stripe down the sides of the neck, the upper parts and breast are medium grey, flanks are grey turning brown on rear flanks, vent and tail border are white, beak is yellow-orange with black tip, and legs and feet are yellow-orange. Both sexes are alike. Source Size: Typical Adult is 71-76cm (28-30in). Food: Aquatic plants, grasses, wheat, barley, and rice. Habitat/Range: Wetlands, high-altitude lakes, and cultivated fields in central Asia, and Tibet. They winter further south in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Pairing: They're monogamous throughout a breeding season, and generally gather in colonies of up to 1,000 pairs. (Note the group in the final picture below.) This unique goose is the highest flying bird found, according to a fascinating study reported in National Geographic . Yearly migration is triggered by an environmental signal that allows them to miss the summer monsoon season and the worst winter storms. To migrate from India to Mongolia for breeding, they have to fly over the Himalaya mountain range, the tallest mountain range in the world. In 2009, an international team of researchers tagged 25 bar-headed geese in India with GPS transmitters in order to monitor their two-month migration. They reached a peak height of nearly 21,120 feet (6,437 meters), and covered a distance up to 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers)! The birds made frequent rest stops during the migration, but they appear to have flown over the Himalayan portion of their journey in a single effort that took about eight hours on average and that included little or no rest. A similar intense climb could kill a human without proper acclimatization, Hawkes said. Biological information: They need extreme amounts of energy. Other high-flyers glide on currents, but these flap their wings the whole time. (See the picture below.) They can fly over 50 miles an hour without wind to assist them, and their strength enables them to fly in crosswinds without being blown off course! They fly through the passes of the highest mountains with winds that blow at speeds of more than 200 mph and temperatures low enough to freeze exposed flesh instantly. At this height, oxygen levels drop by one-third; even kerosene cannot burn there and helicopters cannot fly there. Their powerful and constant flight helps generate body heat, which is retained by their down feathers. Such heat helps keep ice from building up on their wings when flying over mountains. They have a special type of hemoglobin in their blood that absorbs oxygen more quickly than other birds; they can also extract more oxygen from each breath than other birds can. They're important to the study of humans and altitude. Researchers believe better data about their resistance to extreme temperatures will be valuable in helping humans better cope with altitude and respiratory diseases. This group is flying above the Tibetan Plateau . ( Picture source ) Here is a group resting at home in the Maguri-Motapung Beel wetland in Tinsukia, India .

Are there any in the United States?",Lava tubes,"Basically, a lava tube is formed when a underground lava flow stops flowing, leaving behind a long tubular cave. A lava tube is a natural conduit formed by flowing lava which moves beneath the hardened surface of a lava flow. Tubes can be draining lava from a volcano during an eruption, or can be extinct, meaning the lava flow has ceased and the rock has cooled and left a long cave. Lava tubes are a type of lava cave formed when a low-viscosity lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust, which thickens and forms a roof above the still-flowing lava stream. Tubes form in one of two ways: by the crusting over of lava channels, and from pƒÅhoehoe flows where the lava is moving under the surface. 1 Source This is what the lava tubes at Mammoth Cave (Utah) look like,",Lava tubes,0.037135713,386,396,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17197
17415,,"What would be the disadvantage of racking trad gear around the shoulders rather than the harness, if any?",it tends to get in your way as you climb,"First of all, racking on your shoulders isn't meant to substitute racking on your belt. Supplementary shoulder racks are meant to provide you with additional racking points for climbs where you are carrying a lot of extra gear. You missed the most advantageous point to racking around your shoulders, which is passing gear to your climbing partner when you're multi-pitching. When I lead on trad I always give my follower a sling to put over their shoulder to rack all the gear to when they clean the pitch. This way when they get up to the next belay they can just hand me the whole rack instead of passing each piece of gear off their belt one at a time. This saves you a tonne of time transitioning between pitches, speeds your ascent, and ensures that your follower doesn't forget to pass you that one critical go-to piece of gear you use on every pitch. The main disadvantage to climbing with a rack over your shoulders is it tends to get in your way as you climb, especially when you're racking out in front of you; your gear hangs out in front while you're trying to climb over bulges and you end up kneeling on it, it snags on cracks as you're trying to make a move off some thin holds and throws you off balance, you get stuck, etc. It's best to rack you belt first, then when you run out of room, put the rest of your rack on your shoulder slings. Even when you do, you want to rack those bottom loops on the slings first, to keep the gear as low and a far back as possible, you'd only ever rack the loops high on your shoulders when the other loops are already full.",it tends to get in your way as you climb,0.191049635,928,968,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17415

20937,,What to do if woke up in a tent hearing a bear/boar or something else close by?,go back to sleep,"The majority of bear attacks are the result of surprise encounters, particularly involving a mother with cubs. In a surprise encounter, the bear is acting defensively, and wants to eliminate a potential threat. Predatory attacks are extremely rare, particularly where you're located. Bears have an extremely sensitive sense of smell. There's a story I've heard of a bear that broke into a backcountry cabin in Yellowstone and raided the food cache - it reportedly bit into all the cans except the peas. Their senses of hearing and sight, however, are similar to that of a human. Put all this together, and it's likely that the bear already knows you're there (a surprise encounter is unlikely), and either finds you uninteresting or already knows to avoid you. From there, you could take Jon Custer's advice and go back to sleep (ok, I probably wouldn't be able to either!) If it were me, I would talk to the bear in a low voice, let it know that I'm there and that I'm a human , and odds are it will go away on its own. Since the bear knows you're there, it's unlikely to be startled, and you've prevented the most likely bad outcome. I mean, fight for your life if it gets predatory, but that's highly unlikely. In regards to bears, what you're describing is probably not as dangerous a situation as it may feel like. Most bear attacks happen when a bear is startled (it already knows you're there) You're not inviting a feeding response, like if you were a hunter with a fresh kill. It should be noted that bears are omnivores, and can be attracted to all food smells, not just meat! You should absolutely keep all food items unavailable to bears. Bears can be curious and inquisitive, but generally take all opportunities to avoid humans A bear attacking a sleeping human in a tent is so rare as to elicit national news coverage when it happens. My recommendation: Listen, take stock of what the animal is doing, it may walk off on its own once it realizes that it has nothing to gain by remaining in your camp. From the animal's perspective, a human camp might be so unusual that it's already wary. If the animal doesn't go away on its own, talk to it from your tent. Eliminate the possibility of surprise if you do choose to go outside to investigate. Listen and assess. Are you in an area where animals might be habituated to humans and see campsites as a food opportunity? If the animal knows you're there and isn't leaving, stepping out of your tent is probably a good idea. At this stage, more information is better anyway. Avoid making sudden movements or sudden loud noises while you're getting out of the tent, and definitely bring the pepper spray (wait to take the safety off until you're out of the tent!) Assess. What's the animal, and how many are there? How is it reacting to your presence? Are there cubs? Is there a building or vehicle you can (slowly) retreat to? If the animal is not bothered by your presence at this point, you didn't want it to be there to begin with. It might be habituated to humans, and you don't want it to be in your camp - for your sake, and also for whoever will camp there in the future. Talk to it, stand your ground, raise your arms so it can smell that you're human. If needed, shout, clap, do whatever you need to do - you don't want this animal where you're sleeping. You raise a fair point - this is all bear-specific, and I hope it's still helpful. Where I've spent time (Montana and Alaska) wolves are present, but wolf attacks just don't happen.

( 40.3523ÀöN, -79.8714ÀöW ) easily viable from the river, and the fifth avenue bridge. The launch is across the river from the trail, taking a canoe across the bridge on the crosswalk is possible. The next down stream launch accessible by a bike towing a canoe is Pittsburgh South Side Riverfront park (left bank) 14 miles away. Down river is to the right, 4 miles on the Monongahela takes you to the Braddock Locks & Dam (Lock on Right bank) 11th Street Braddock, PA 15104-1704 412-271-1272 Source Braddock Dam has two locks, one for large commercial tugs and barges, the smaller for pleasure boats. Tugs use the lock on the bank side, while small boats use the one closer to the dam. They are only separated by a few feet of concrete. There is a sign directing small boats to pull the cord for access, there is a stop light to provide stop/go direction. This is a twelve foot elevation change, 50 feet of rope is required to tie off during lock operation. There is a Ramp Launch just down from the dam right river (bike trail is left river), there are 10 miles of river before arriving at the Point of Pittsburgh (right bank) and the Ohio River.

There are several drawbacks to the yoke: the o-ring is on the cylinder and is very frequently damaged the o-ring can be damaged when your kit is assembled if the yoke's twisted or incorrectly seated when the o-ring breaks, it goes bang - scaring anyone around! it's possible to undo a yoke under pressure, it goes bang yokes are limited to 232 bar max yokes are more fragile and are not recommended for diving in an overhead environment: cave, wreck, etc. where they may strike something underwater. Therefore technical divers can't/won't use them. DIN is a much newer connector so is far more reliable, cannot be removed under pressure, and seldom goes bang. Most DIN regulators work up to 300 bar as the male screw is longer with 8 threads as opposed to 5 threads. You cannot use a 232 regulator on a 300 bar cylinder (e.g. a suit inflation first stage) as the seal cannot be made (it's short but the female socket is deeper). In Europe, most people use DIN. If travelling, it's useful to pack a DIN to yoke adapter just in case. If you're in the US and have no intentions to move into technical diving, choose yoke.

20167,,What to do if you are above timberline and your descent is cut off by a large forest fire?,report it immediately,"RETREAT Your option 2 is best, but having said that, rescue crews will want to know you're out there sooner than later. In the option 1 you described, you would be activating your PLB, then waiting for rescue above the treeline. Fire doesn't go very far above treeline, but smoke, ash, embers and heat do. Just because you're above the treeline doesn't mean you're guaranteed to be safe from the fire, you just won't likely get burned to death, but death by flames isn't the only way to die in a forest fire. When the Kenow wildfire burned 38,000 hectares of forest last summer, the ash from the fire was piling up in my back yard 50km away. Air quality was so bad that we had to stay indoors with all the windows closed, and the sun was blotted out for weeks. If you are on a mountain directly above a blazing forest fire, your odds of dying from smoke inhalation are pretty good, but breathing in a hot breath of superheated air is what usually kills people trapped by fire. The situation you described is the exact reason why parks require people to buy backcountry permits to go backcountry camping. Park staff need to have a record of how many people are deep in the backcountry, so they know in a situation like a forest fire how many people they need to evacuate. If you're going to a spot where they don't require permits, then make sure someone knows where you are, or at the very least leave a note on your vehicle indicating where you have gone and when you expect to return. If you are in the backcountry and discover a fire, you must report it immediately , especially if you are above the fire and it has you cut off from your escape route. You're best chance of surviving a fire is to reatreat! If you are on top of a mountain, this means getting off the mountain . Do not hang out on the rock and expect you're going to be safe, you need to get off that mountain as fast as you can, if you know of an alternate route, take it. Rations are the least of your concerns when running from a wildfire. You can survive days without food and water, but you will not survive breathing in unrelenting plumes of smoke or superheated air. (One caution with descending a mountain is to choose your route wisely; if you get ledged-out on the decent you can get yourself in just about as much trouble as being stuck in the path of a fire.) In any case, your first course of action should be to call for help, if you have no means of contacting Emergency Crews, and no way to evade the fire, then use your PLB. Rescue crews will want to know that you are out there. The problem with using your PLB is that once you deploy it you typically need to hang around in one spot in order for rescue crews to find you. If you're in the smoke however, it's unlikely they will ever find you, so deploying it is not going to help you get found unless you can get out of the smoke to somewhere open and visible.",report it immediately,0.480959326,1547,1568,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/20167

9195,,"What order of response time can I expect if I hit the ""911"" button on my SPOT Satellite Personal Tracker?",11 minutes,"Types of satellite-based emergency beacons Personal Locator Beacons Personal Locator Beacons (or PLBs) have one and only one purpose: to send your location to emergency responders, indicating that you need some kind of urgent help . They use a satellite network operated by government agencies worldwide, and send your distress call directly to a government-run rescue coordination center. When you initiate a distress call, the following sequence of events happens (from REI's article on PLBs and locator beacons ): PLBs transmit powerful signals at 406 MHz (MegaHertz), an internationally recognized distress frequency monitored in the U.S. by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the AFRCC (Air Force Rescue Coordination Center). A PLB communicates with a network of Russian, Canadian, American and French military satellites known as COSPAS-SARSAT (SARSAT is an acronym for ""Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking""). After receiving your transmission, these satellites ""fix"" on your location using a Doppler Shift method and relay your information to the AFRCC where search and rescue procedures begin. If you use a GPS-compatible PLB, you can deliver your GPS coordinates very quickly without having to wait for the satellites to determine your position. Assuming you are in a location where the signal can be picked up by a satellite ‚Äì which they almost always can be ‚Äì the AFRCC will receive your call almost immediately. Most PLBs these days are GPS-integrated. If you use a PLB with a GPS interface, the 406 MHz signal will guide rescuers to an area less than 100 meters from your position. At the same time, they will employ a tracking device to home in on the 121.5 MHz frequency put out by the PLB. When using a GPS-compatible PLB in the continental U.S, it takes only 5 minutes to alert search-and- rescue personnel of your position So, it takes about 5 minutes with a PLB for the AFRCC to determine your location. Commercial Satellite Based Systems There are various commercial emergency beacons, like your SPOT Messenger, which use privately owned satellites to relay emergency messages or other messages. They usually require an annual subscription, whereas PLBs only have the up-front purchase cost. SPOT and many other companies use the GEOS International Emergency Rescue Coordination Center (IERCC) which is based in Houston, Tx. According to SPOT's info pages: Once activated, SPOT will acquire its exact coordinates from the GPS network, and send that location along with a distress message to the GEOS International Emergency Response Center every five minutes until cancelled or until the batteries are depleted. The Emergency Response Center notifies the appropriate emergency responders based on your GPS location and personal information ‚Äì which may include local police, highway patrol, the Coast Guard, our country‚Äôs embassy or consulate, or other emergency search and rescue teams ‚Äì as well as notifying your emergency contacts about the receipt of a distress signal. The IERCC is manned 24/7 with dedicated and highly trained operatives who have access to emergency responders worldwide to ensure that in an emergency your situation will be dealt with efficiently and you will receive the resources you need. In fact, the average response time from the receipt of your 911/SOS message until referring an emergency responder is only 11 minutes, wherever you are in the world. Once a SOS/911 message has been received, the IERCC calls your emergency contact(s) to make sure that it wasn't a false alarm. They locate and notify an emergency responder, and then maintain an open line of communication, including providing updates of your location if needed. The IERCC will also keep your emergency contact(s) informed. The response speed of the GEOS IERCC is going to depend on how well-connected they are with emergency responders in your area, but it looks like it takes about 11 minutes for SPOT's service to determine your location and contact the authorities. Once ""The Authorities"" have been notified Once they have been alerted, the time for rescue crews to actually show up is going to be dependent on many factors, including: How easy it is to contact the appropriate SAR agency in your area, and how many levels of communication it takes to get there. For example, in a national park it's pretty easy for the AFRCC or IERCC to contact the park dispatch and initiate a SAR response. In more remote areas it may take time to contact an agency like the local Sheriff office, the National Guard, or some other agency. How long it takes a SAR team to initiate a response after being notified. Most Coast Guard air stations and some Air Force helicopter SAR units maintain a 24 hour alert posture, with a crew able to depart within 15-30 minutes of receiving a call. Most National Guard units provide 24-hour response but may have to call crews from home during off-hours, and can have anywhere from a 15 minute to a 1 hour time from receiving a call to a helicopter lifting off. Ground-based SAR teams which are not on 24-hour standby often take a long time to assemble, especially volunteer teams. While a first responder, such as a Sheriff SAR deputy or an NPS rescue ranger may be able to respond quickly, a fully-assembled team capable of performing technical rescue or a litter evacuation commonly takes several hours to assemble personnel and equipment. How long it takes for a SAR team to reach the area. This depends on where the nearest SAR resources are and their availability. In the Sierras and Rockies you might see a helicopter within a matter of hours, if weather allows and resources are available. In a remote part of Alaska it may take a day for a plane to do a fly-by and assess the accessibility of the location. How long it takes a SAR team to actually find you. These devices transmit a homing signal as mentioned above, and with GPS they'll already have a pretty good idea. If there's dense tree cover or poor visibility though, it may take time for a crew to actually locate your exact position. Once they reach you, the time for a rescue to take place. Helicopters can't land everywhere, and ground teams can take a long time to arrive. With either a PLB or a commercial device, the response time is going to mostly be a factor of your location, not the signal getting out. The signal will be located quickly, but rescue crews may take minutes to hours to arrive depending on the situation. Making yourself easy to find If you have a GPS-based device, rescue crews should be able to locate you to within ¬±100m, so you don't generally need a long-distance signal like a smoke column. Making a fire (if conditions are appropriate and safe to do so) can help especially at night. A signaling mirror is very helpful in daylight for catching a pilot's attention. Place yourself in a wide open area if possible. At night you can use a flashlight to get the attention of helicopters once you hear them nearby. Once you've been noticed, don't shine the flashlight directly at the cockpit as pilots will be using night-vision goggles and could be blinded. Large areas of unnatural colors, such as a bright tarp or tent, can also help you to stand out.",11 minutes,0.774272203,3389,3399,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9195

20162,,What is the best way to place a sling on a rock spike so that it's prevented from lifting off?,tie a knot,"Here are some ideas, with the usefulness depending on the terrain and rock quality and the terrain: Hold it down with an upside-down nut: Place a nut below the spike and clip it to the sling. The nut needs to pull down on the sling so that the sling won't move. The nut will only need to resist being pulled upwards slightly since its only purpose is to prevent the sling from moving. Tie it off : On some spikes, you might be able to tightly tie a knot in the sling, so that it is held firmly by some feature of the rock (e.g. a crack, or some kind of protrusion) which prevents it from slipping off. A simple overhand knot works well is many cases. Note: do not use a ""self-tightening"" knot such as a girth hitch to tie the sling around the spike. If there is no feature of the rock that prevents the sling from going up (such as protrusions or horizontal edges), these knots will tend to slide upwards and not down again and, thus, actually increase the chance of the sling sliding off! Weigh it down : Clip some heavy-ish equipment (e.g. carabiners, hexes) to the sling, so that its weight counters the movement from rope drag. Use fuzzier PA slings: Dyneema slings are often slippery. If all else fails, a slightly fuzzy (i.e. not brand-new) and wider PA sling will provide more friction with the rock and might better resist movement if the rock is somewhat rough.",tie a knot,0.02960282,443,453,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/20162

Hydromantes platycephalus . That page has excellent pictures of both the salamanders and the mountains on which you'll find them. The basic descriptions I've found from a number of sources match yours in terms of coloration, although at certain life stages parts of them can be tinged with yellow or silver. They have that dark mottled pattern, and a tail that looks like stone. They also have webbed feet with the correct amount of toes, which is four on the front and five on the back. Other salamanders in the same species have different numbers of toes. From Amphibia Web : This species of Hydromantes has a flattened head and body, as the name--platy (flat)-cephalus (referring to the head)--suggests; blunt snout; short, blunt tail and a pedicelled, mushroom-shaped tongue (Stebbins 1951). There are 4 blunt-tipped, partly webbed toes on the front feet, and 5 on the hind feet. Adults reach about 120 mm (4.72 inches) total length, and usually have 12-13 costal grooves. Males are usually longer than females and have wider heads (Adams 1942). Color: Dark chocolate to blackish above, with mottled pale gray to pinkish patches composed of whitish flecks; in some individuals, mottling completely obscures dark ground color; the dorsal coloration tends to match the color and pattern of granite rock common in this salamander's habitat, and varies among populations as substrate color varies. Ventral color is sooty to blackish often broken by irregular clusters of silvery chromophores, especially beneath limbs, on gular region, and on sides of belly. Juveniles: Completely dark brown to black with scattered golden stippling, or clusters of pale yellow chromophores dorsally. The Mt. Lyell is one of the few varieties of salamander in California that are indigenous to the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Almost all other California salamanders are in the Western part of the state, and even at the Pacific coastal region. Adult Habitat: Favored habitats are downslope from melting snowfields, which persist long into or even through the summer in the high Sierra Nevada. Individuals also are encountered under rocks at the edge of streams; at low elevations, they may be found in direct contact with moist soil under rocks or occasionally under pieces of wood. Salamanders also are found under moss on wet rock faces (e.g., in Yosemite Valley). Source Your hiking range of about 11,000 feet makes sense. Its altitudinal range is 1,220‚Äì3,660 m (4,000‚Äì12,010 ft) above sea level. Source Another thing that makes me feel fairly confident in this identification is the outside temperature of 40¬∞. Also, that you saw it at night, as it's generally nocturnal. This species is nocturnal and cold tolerant down to 35 degrees F. (2.0 C). Surface activity is from late April to early September. Mt. Lyell Salamanders probably move into below-ground microhabitats and remain inactive during winter freezes and summer droughts, but they remain active underground during the summer. Source It looks like you left that one where you found it, which is always important with anything we come across outside. Also, it's unlawful to take or own one in California because it's protected. Conservation: Mt. Lyell salamanders enjoy protected status and appear to be in good condition. Much of their range is in National Parks and Wilderness Areas, so there are few threats from human activities, although road construction in the Sonora Pass region could harm excellent habitat, that occurs near roadside. They are protected as a species of Special Concern by the California Department of Fish and Game and may not be taken or possessed at any time.

A good example of a single action is the M1911 pistol . Double Action/Single Action (DA/SA) A double action/single action will both cock and drop the hammer onto the primer. This makes it possible to carry the gun with a round in the chamber and the hammer down while not having to manually cock the hammer. However this means that the first trigger pull will be longer and heavier then the subsequent shots, which will be fired in single action mode. A good example of this would be the Beretta 92 . Double Action Only (DAO) A double action only does not fully cock the firing mechanism (usually a striker instead of an external hammer) upon firing but rather the cocking is accomplished by pulling the trigger each time. This has the advantage of all of the trigger pulls being the same as opposed to the (DA/SA) actions. An example would be the SIG Sauer P250 As for the differences in terminology between revolvers and semi-autos, Whether it is single of double action matters for every shot with a revolver, while after the first shot with a semi-auto the difference between single action and double action/single action no longer matters since the action of the slide after firing loads a round and cocks the hammer. Pulling the trigger on a double action revolver will rotate the cylinder bringing a live round under the hammer. This is not true of semi-auto pistols as a round has to be chambered manually and firing that round will load the next one.",no longer matters,0.167420223,1363,1380,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18455

At the upper end of the range you quote (in the fifties F, 10+ degrees C), you will be warm (unless you are wet). So obviously, it is the lower end of the range that is of concern. We do our backpacking with a three-season tent, with rainfly; your tent sounds as though it is better in the cold than ours, but possibly not. We camped as low as 4 degrees F, and although it was a horrible night (more later), the tent was not the problem. Assuming your tent is in good condition, it is adequate for your conditions. On to your sleeping bag. I can't remember if our bags are rated to zero F or to 10 degrees F. Ours are definitely are not rated to below zero, F, but they are warmer than your 32 degree bag. They have always been adequate, although marginal in the 4 degrees F night. One beautiful, clear night we didn't bother setting up the tent, and camped under the stars beside the Tuolumne River. We woke up to find our bags looked like skating rinks. They were covered with icy snow, moisture condensed and frozen on the bags. Our thermometer said the temperature had bottomed at 19 degrees F. We were perfectly warm and comfortable all night. Your sleeping bag is most likely marginal at the lowest of your range, but adequate because you can wear your parka inside the bag. What will make you miserable is damp socks on a cold night. Take one more pair of socks than you think you will need. Now for the pad. I'm not familiar with the pad you describe, and I don't know the R value of our pads. They are just ensolite pads, not thick, not special, not expensive. They have always been enough, except for that 4 degree F night, and their inadequacy was the source of our misery. However, we were camped on snow -- there was no bare ground anywhere -- and in the early night, heat escaped from our bodies and melted the snow beneath us, which later in the night froze. We were trying to sleep in a narrow, shallow depression of ice that had frozen into the position we occupied during our first period of sleep. The pad would probably have been adequate if there had been no snow, and I think a second pad apiece would have made us far more comfortable. I'll guess that your pad is adequate except for sleeping on snow.

If you are just ""glacier hiking"" and maybe (indeed this is very likely on most alpine tours) also having rock contact with your crampons, I won't sharp them at all.

9116,,When I do and when I don't need shoes with ankle supports?,most of the time,"The question has the tag ""mountaineering,"" but most of the time when I hear people say that you need boots with ankle support, they're actually talking about trail-walking. The cases of hiking and mountaineering are qualitatively different. For mountaineering, one big reason people usually don't use lightweight running shoes is that often there is talus, scree, and loose rock. Small scree is a nuisance if it gets inside your shoes, although there are lightweight gaiters with velcro attachments (e.g., Dirty Girl) that do a great job of keeping that out. The bigger issue is that on a steep scree or talus slope (the kind of thing you have to scramble up, not a trail), there is often unstable rock, and it can be nice to have your feet protected against getting banged or crushed. When coming down a scree slope, boots allow you to do a scree glassade, which is much faster and infinitely more fun than the alternative. For trail walking, the idea of wearing heavy boots for ankle support is at best a matter of personal preference, and at worst a harmful superstition. Plenty of people carry heavy packs over uneven ground while wearing running shoes. An influential advocate of lightweight shoes for this purpose was Ray Jardine, who wrote the 1992 book Beyond Backpacking . IIRC Jardine describes in the book how he goes on long-distance backpacking trips with his girlfriend (doing something like 25 miles a day), and he uses running shoes while she uses boots; he portrays it as a matter of personal preference. The problem with boots is that they're heavy, and weight on your feet hurts your efficiency many times more than an equivalent weight carried on your back. Also, the heavier your footwear, the harder it is to get a comfortable fit and the more likely you are to get blisters. Running shoes do become impractical in very specific situations. They aren't good in snow, for slogging through deep mud, for technical rock climbing, or for very cold conditions. Sometimes if you have a day of hiking with 20 or 30 little stream crossings, it can be a real nuisance to use running shoes; if you're wearing water-resistant boots, you can walk straight through a shallow stream. Running shoes don't work well if there's a lot of snow (although it can be done -- a lot of PCTers get through the Sierra in early season using running shoes). And running shoes are obviously not compatible with crampons, although it is possible to throw a pair of microspikes in your pack if you think you might just encounter a few isolated icy patches on a steep trail. For people who are afraid they'll turn an ankle if they try to use running shoes with a heavy pack on uneven ground, there are still alternatives to boots. One is simply to keep doing the activity in running shoes, which will strengthen your ankles until you feel more physically confident. Another is to adopt a lightweight or ultralight style of backpacking, so that you're not tottering down the trail with the Leaning Tower of Pisa on your back. Jardine's book was an early influence in establishing the concept of ultralight backpacking, but today a better source of information is probably the web site backpackinglight . Four mountaineering, many people carry a separate pair of lightweight approach shoes that are more comfortable than mountaineering boots. They hike in to the climb in the approach shoes, then switch to the boots when the real mountaineering starts. There are specialized shoes sold for this, such as the Evolv Cruzer, that flatten down really small in your pack when you're not using them.",most of the time,0.172092915,47,63,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9116

Hygienic reasons where washing your socks hot (95 ¬∞C) and frequently is important. I guess the most common such reason (besides being doctor/nurse/...) is having a fungal infection. In that case in addition to the proper medication you should change your socks frequently (if they get moist even more often than daily) and wash them really hot so your feet do not get re-infected next time you wear those socks and get them moist. However, in that foot condition long hikes closed boots are not a good idea, so not sure whether this is an ""outdoor"" answer. I've successfully washed synthetics socks at 60 ¬∞C many times that were rated at 30 ¬∞C, but never tried out how they take washing at 95 ¬∞C. I wear cotton socks a lot in everyday life, in winter also woolen socks. I prefer synthetic or wollen socks for longer (several days without time to properly dry boots) hiking tours because I'm afraid once the whole foot-sock-boot business is thoroughly moist (the only time I didn't get moist feet on hiking/skiing so far was a winter spent in Manitoba), the cotton socks would lead to more blisters because they are usually less soft/smooth than the woolen or synthetic socks. As to the retain moisture part, I'm not so sure how much that matters in a closed shoe/boot scenario: usually it is much easier to dry a cotton sock than getting the corresponding moisture out of the shoe. (I guess that is what you were driving at with the not fill the shoe with salt and grease sentence? - though for a leather shoe grease would probably be good, but neither salt nor moisture is.) In the office, I keep a spare pair of (cotton) socks in case I get really soaked biking there (I prefer to change also synthetics socks if they are thoroughly wet). I rarely have cold feet, and drying cotton socks on my feet that are slightly moist after the bike ride to the office is no problem once I've changed the shoes (when sitting at the computer, I usually slip out of the office/lab shoes). Yes they do have a decided price advantage, and in my experience they last at least as long as the synthetics socks. My woolen socks last longer but then I wear them less frequently. If outdoors includes activities where you return indoors in the evening: I often wear cotton socks when working outdoors.

Fraying indicates broken or damaged sheath bundles caused by abrasion or overloading. Glazing and/or glossy marks or hard, stiff areas which signify heat damage. Discoloration, a change in the ropes original color is an indication of chemical damage or overexposure to the elements of nature including UV radiation. Exposed Core Fibers indicate severe sheath damage and possible core damage. A Lack of Uniformity in Diameter or Size indicates core damage. This is noted by a depression in the diameter of the rope, lumpiness of the rope or exposure of white core fibers protruding from the sheath. Flexibility and/or inconsistency in texture including, but not limited to, stiff or soft areas signify possible core damage. Use/Age - the rope is simply worn out from use. We recommend a low elongation/static rope be removed from service after ten years under ideal use and storage condition. Loss of Faith - if you feel uncomfortable for any reason or suspect there may be a problem with your rope it must be retired and destroyed.It is not possible to pre-determine an expected life span for a rescue kernmantle rope. Consistent, accurate record keeping, with a careful inspection program, are the best methods for determining when to remove a rope from service.

8264,0,When to use a static rope?,"rappelling/abseiling, ascending, hauling, rescue work and making anchors","Static ropes are used whenever you're working with a static load, either raising or lowering. Dynamic ropes should be used whenever there is potential for a fall and high impact forces. Static ropes are used for rappelling/abseiling, ascending, hauling, rescue work and making anchors (accessory cord) . Pretty much they are to be used in every situation except for catching a fall. On rappels, static ropes (9-11mm) give you more control on your descent, with dynamic ropes it's often very temping to descend faster because the rope will soak up a lot of the force when you come to a stop, while fun to do, it's not great for your gear or your anchors, you could also put yourself into a dangerous situation by lowering too fast and hitting something or losing control. If you've ever tried to ascend a dynamic rope then you know that it is almost twice as tiring as ascending a static rope, it's the same difference as climbing up stairs vs, hiking up a sand dune. The stretch and bounce in the rope puts excess fatigue on your muscles with every motion, you also feel like you have to climb twice as far because you have to take the stretch out of the rope before you can make any vertical progress. Hauling is done on big wall climbs typically using >7.5mm ropes when you're climbing for multiple days and carrying a lot of gear, static ropes are much easier and faster to pull. In rescue work, large diametre 13mm ropes are pretty much standard, because they regularly have more than one person on a rope and lift victims strapped to a spine board in a basket. You want zero stretch in your rope when you're doing this kind of work, because before you can lift a load you have to first take all the stretch out of it, and when you're dealing with a spinal injury you don't want your rig to bounce around. They also use very complex pulley systems, with dynamic ropes, you would have to pull way more rope through the system. Accessory cord can be categorized as any static rope that is <8mm, it's used to make cordalettes, equalettes, any other kind of anchor or 'lette you can think of, slings, prusiks (although dynamic prusik cord is better, static cords still work) , and back in the day it was used in every size down to 2mm to thread your chocks. You're really only limited by your imagination when it comes down to what you can use accessory cord for. Dynamic ropes are used to absorb shock forces sustained from a fall, if you were to use a static rope for free-climbing the force of a fall would rip your protection out of the wall, or snap you in half when your fall is caught and you stop very suddenly and abruptly.",whenever you're working with a static load,0.690401495,22,64,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8264

Foxes hunt very small animals, humans are way too big for them. Anyway, in their natural habitat they are extremely shy and will run away from you most likely before you are even aware of its presence. Foxes with rabies can lose their natural fear of humans. I know that Switzerland and UK are considered rabies free and I believe this is true for many European countries. So this is no concern in these areas, in other parts of the world it is a valid concern. Not specific to foxes but in many species. Another problem is that foxes penetrate urban areas scavenging for food. There they get somewhat accustomed to people. While this mean that the chances of coming across a fox is higher, they are still shy and will never be the aggressor. Of course the usual applies: If you corner the animal or if you threaten pups, they will attack - but only as the very last measure. To specifically answer the question about whether they attack at day or night: Neither, as explained above. But as they are mainly night active, you are more likely to encounter one at night so the extremely unlikely event of an attack would be more likely at night. One personal experience: We once grilled chicken in the forest close to a city. There was one fox who tried over and over to get close so it can steal some chicken. Whenever we saw it and made any motion towards it, it ran away. However it was extremely cunning at moving in the shades of the trees, so with time it got quite close, but never reached its goal. :)",Foxes do not attack humans.

In humid summer months, sure, condensation can cause precipitation under the tarp, but in winter, this is not so much a concern, and you can pitch it lower to the ground. You might get frost inside - but just shake it off when you pack up. Tents provide a few degrees of warmth by trapping a bit of your body heat - but that thin layer of nylon (or two) can only do so much. (And not near as much as, say, a snow cave.) I have slept in the winter without any shelter in a -40 degree bag, and woke up with 4 inches of snow on me. I was soaked but tolerably comfortable. Had I had a tarp, it would have shed the snow off me, and I would have been perfectly fine in my 15 degree down bag (and, in point of fact, I have done this on several occasions.) So, what is the take home message? If your bag is warm enough, a tarp is just the light-weight ticket to keep you dry.

610,1,When should you repair rock gouges in skis?,before de-lamination begins,"The two biggest risks from gouges: Core Shot : This is when the gouge cuts through the base material* to the core layers of the ski (usually wood or composite material). If moisture gets in between those layers (it will), it can cause the various layers of your ski to separate. This process of de-lamination will rapidly destroy your ski or snowboard and can not be repaired. Edge Separation : If the rock catches on your edge enough to pull it out from between the core and base layers, or mangles it enough to create a gap, this can result in several issues: De-lamination (see above), affect turn performance (you have no edge / uneven edge), laceration risk (those things are sharp even when they are in proper position). Fortunately, both of these cases can be repaired to nearly good as new if you have the tools/knowhow -- but only before de-lamination begins, so act quickly. Beyond that, minor scrapes, dings, etc. that don't make it to the core -- even super-long and gnarly looking ones -- are fine up to your personal preference.

4936,1,When to perform a filtering of the water?,"right away, when filling the bottle","Filter the water right away, when filling the bottle. This way I'm sure the water inside the bottle is safe for drinking. This. Why? The main point for me is accessibility of that water. If you come to a situation where you need fresh water, then it may not just be because you've set up camp, you've got a while to spare and you feel like a drink. It may be (for example) that you've cut yourself and need to wash the wound, and in that case you won't have time to sit there with a filter and sort it out - so chances are you'd just use the water as is or go without, neither of which are ideal scenarios. Practical reasons are also worth pointing out - dealing with dirty and fresh water in separate bottles has the potential for getting them mixed, especially if you're tired after a long day of hiking, that could go rather wrong. These chances are compounded if you're hiking with someone else who may not know what water you've put in what bottle. Personally I wouldn't be worried about a bit of filter life here and there, I'd much prefer to have a stable, fresh supply of water I don't need to worry about. Also worth mentioning as your third option - good filters are really rather slow, so I'd be incredibly wary of using any filter that was in the straw directly.

This question really ventures into Leave No Trace ethics. Even if you're not in a Park or forest reserve, the fact that you can go off trail shouldn't serve as an invitation to indiscriminately trample around in the forest. Even the wild animals will make trails and stick to them, that's what most of the trails in the woods back home were; game trails made by elk, bears or mountain sheep. If I'm venturing into untamed forrest, and find a game trail, I'll typically follow it for as long as I can. As a rule of thumb, always stick to the trail, especially in frequented areas. In places where venturing off trail is allowed, try to do your best to minimize your impact on the forrest floor. Back home we had a lot of deadfall in the lodgepole pine forests. So we could actually move through the woods without touching the ground by walking on the fallen logs. Avoid stepping on vegetation, especially soft mossy fragile areas, and look for routes that follow more rocky ground.

21335,,When to plant a potted live Christmas tree?,within 10 to 12 days,"Thanks for buying a live tree! We're in Massachusetts, and had success under the direction of a horticulturist. The tree must be inside for the least possible amount of time, no more than a week or two, so don't buy it too many days before Christmas, and plant it as soon as you can after the holiday. Too much time in a warm dry room will cause difficulty adjusting to its natural conditions. It may even sprout new growth that will die once you put it out, compromising the entire tree. Our tree was dug up the day before we got it; stayed in our 3-season room with daytime temperatures in the 50s F, nights in the 30s F; and transplanted out on the 11th day. You only need sufficient thawed ground and sun in the place you're going to put it, even if other areas are frozen. Even if the ground freezes after you've prepared the hole, you can still plant the tree, using the dirt you dug up. Many people dig the hole earlier in the season. Caring for and planting live Christmas trees : Try to plant the tree immediately after the holiday hoopla has ended. The tree should not be stored above ground during the winter if it can be avoided. It‚Äôs not a good idea to store it in your garage either, as it is likely to dry out in there. The best place for live Christmas trees is to be is planted in the ground, even if the ground was frozen as soon as the hole was dug. Just set the tree in the hole and backfill the hole with the loose soil you saved in your wheelbarrow. From Replanting a Christmas Tree : When you decide to replant a Christmas tree outside after the holidays, you also need to accept that you will not be able to enjoy the tree indoors as long as you would a cut tree. This is because indoor conditions can put a live Christmas tree at risk. Expect that your Christmas tree will only be able to be in the house for 1 to 1¬Ω weeks. Any longer than this, you reduce the chance that your Christmas tree will be able to adapt to conditions outside again. All trees are susceptible to Transplant Shock . The tree has already been transplanted when you get it. Further transplants increase the stress, so the entire process must be done carefully. Ours was a four foot tall blue spruce, and came with the roots in a burlap bag. These instructions from our horticulturist worked perfectly. While inside: Keep the rootball intact in its original burlap (If yours isn't in burlap, the same instructions are fine. Just gather the roots together.) Put it in a tub with a diameter just a few larger than the rootball Water it every few days from the top, keeping the rootball moist but not soggy or sitting in a lot of stagnant water Keep it in a cool room if possible. Don't use hot Christmas lights, and only leave them on for short periods of time For planting: Before purchase, dig a hole at least 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep Plant the tree outside within 10 to 12 days Set it into the hole with the rootball level with the ground Backfill the hole with its own dirt and some light mulch or shredded leaves Don't water the hole, the dirt, the rootball, or the tree during planting Don't water the tree at all until about 3 months from Christmas, at the end of March Here are some pictures.

Run the full protocol, including yelling out ""MAN OVERBOARD"" (even it's it's a female hat). Set up deliberate drills by throwing a fender overboard. Practice in a variety of conditions (especially wind strength) and various points of sail. If you use a motor and you're unskilled, you could hit the MOB with the boat or prop. Don't do that! You can rescue a MOB under sail, and it's a good way to improve your sailing skills. There are many approaches, and sailors like to argue which is best. Maybe you tack, maybe you jibe. Approach from below the MOB, so you can point in to the wind and come to a stop just at the MOB (much like docking under sail). This gives you time to try multiple attempts to get the MOB out if necessary, whereas a downwind approach lets you have one try at it. To get to the downwind side, usually use a figure 8 pattern - this makes it easier to keep eyes on the MOB. To pull someone out of the water when they're wearing a PFD: Grab by the shoulders of the PFD Push down They will pop up; use the momentum to help pull them in to the boat.

7005,,When should you use gear to climb a tree?,if: A risk assessment has shown that the work can be done safely,"I think this is quite a tricky one. Even when I read the Health & Safety Executive guidance in the UK (a country quite keen on its health and safety rules) it isn't clear: HSE has an 'Are You a Tree Surgeon' page, which links directly to their Working at Height page. There we have: Falls from height are the biggest cause of workplace deaths and one of the biggest causes of major injury. In tree work, falls from height are still common, and the result is often death or major injury. Around 16% of all reported tree work accidents involve falling from height and about 6% are due to uncontrolled swings in the tree leading to impact with branches or the trunk. They provide a range of guidance statements, but nothing that defines what height counts. Hierarchy of control measures For every task that needs to be done at height you need to assess the risk and put appropriate control measures in place. There is a hierarchy of control measures that you need to follow. You only move up the hierarchy when you decide that the control is not practicable. Avoid the need to work at height, for example by using extending equipment from the ground Prevent falls using appropriate access equipment such as work platforms or rope access Reduce the distance and consequences of a fall should one occur. Tree Climbing Operations also gives the following: The Regulations say that climbing work with a personal fall protection system - ropes and harness - can only be done if: A risk assessment has shown that the work can be done safely while using that system The use of other, safer work equipment (e.g. mobile elevating work platforms) is not justified The user and a sufficient number of available people have received training specific to the task, including rescue techniques. So in summary, you should use some common sense risk assessment. HSE reckons tree climbing should be avoided if possible, but if you need to then take precautions.

17193,,"When, how and by whom was sport climbing invented?",Edlinger and Berhault,"As far as I know, the ""change of paradigm"" that led to the birth of sport climbing happened between the 70s and the 80s, and it happened separately in Europe and in the United States. From the early 1900s to the 50s, rock climbing was mostly seen as a ""tool"" necessary to reach the summit of a mountain. There was no real distinction between ""aid climbing"" and ""free climbing"", too: the goal was to reach new summits and to establish new bold first ascents in the mountains, whatever the means. Of course, there were those who advocated a purer climbing style, as for example the german Paul Preuss : In the next few months he made the second ascents of Angelo Dibona's routes on the Croz dell'Altissimo and the Northwest Ridge of the Grossen √ñdstein, making a point of not using any of the pitons left by the first ascensionists, thereby putting into practice his desire to climb as his predecessors Georg Winkler and Emil Zsigmondy had: in a pure style, meaning without any artificial aids [...] . Pitons and carabiners were just starting to be effectively adapted for use in the mountains. At first they were just used for protection or securing a rappel line, but then increasingly became used for upward progress, for instance as hand or footholds, or to secure the rope for a pendulum or tension traverse. To Preuss this was nothing less than cheating . Preuss even wrote a series of principles to express his ethics of climbing, criticizing the use of any artificial mean (including the rope) for the progression. However, people like Preuss were rare, and most of the alpinists in the world didn't bother about how a summit was reached, as long as it was reached. The debate about the the ethics of climbing made a return at the end of the 60s and of the early 70s: the advances in technology and the diffusion of the expansion bolt had made possible to climb almost anything, as long as you had enough gear and patience. The excessive use of bolts and artificial means was strongly criticzed, amongst the others, by Reinhold Messner in Italy, who wrote in 1968 the famous article The murder of the impossible and by Royal Robbins in the USA, which described his ideas in the book Advanced rockcraft (1973). Adventure and boldness were still considered prominent in rock climbing, and not much stress was put on technical difficulty. Therefore, using too many artificial means was seen as a betrayal of all climbing was about. Things started to change in the late 70s/ early 80s. In some circles attention began to shift from the heroism of climbing to the technical difficulty. An important step in this process was the invention of modern rubber-soled climbing shoes in the early 80s . Figure: The Boreal Fire', probably the first modern climbing shoe ( source ) In Europe, one of the birthplaces of free climbing was the Gorges du Verdon: But the Verdon is perhaps best known as a climbing destination‚Äîand one of the birthplaces of sport climbing , a genre defined by the use of bolts, drilled into the rock, to protect climbers. By the mid-1980s, the Verdon was the world‚Äôs first prominent climbing area to feature, almost entirely, all-bolted routes . - Exploring the Birthplace of Sport Climbing in Europe‚Äôs Grandest Canyon The two most famous pioneers of sport climbing of sport climbing in Verdon were the two Patricks: Edlinger and Berhault. I don't know much about the birth of sport climbing in the USA, but this article identifies Smith Rock as one of the birthplaces of this activity: A 1982 Climbing article mentioned Smith‚Äôs shift from aid climbing to free climbing, but the most significant changes had just begun. [...] ‚ÄúWe were pushing each other, and once we had done all the existing climbs, we had to find something else to do,‚Äù he explains. ‚Äú There weren‚Äôt many cracks left, but there were so many beautiful faces and ar√™tes .‚Äù The problem was lack of protection, and rather than run it out, Watts began experimenting with rappelling down potential climbs, cleaning loose rock, and hand-drilling a few protection bolts . ‚Äú It was a big shift, putting up the bolts and making the routes as hard as we possibly could ,‚Äù says Watts. ‚ÄúWe were just trying to raise the standard.‚Äù Unlike places like Yosemite Valley and Joshua Tree, where rap bolting had a stigma that led to controversy and even violence, sport climbing was quickly accepted at Smith, mainly because of the area‚Äôs isolation. By the mid-1980s , there were dozens of 5.12 and 5.13 routes at Smith, including many that remain popular classics today. Another important event that marks the birth of sport climbing is the first climbing competition: Sportroccia , in 1985 at Bardonecchia, Italy. The competition took place on real rock, and not on artificial walls like modern competitions.

1819,,When do I need a permit to go into nature?,when you arrive in an area,"Short Answer: In the US, laws regulating land use are detailed and varied, even on Public Lands. Check with the local land agency before ""roaming."" Long Answer: Loosely you can divide open space in the US into two main categories: Private and Public. Private Land : The laws governing private land vary by state. In Texas, for example, a landowner is well within his rights to shoot trespassers that he ""reasonably feels"" are threatening him, or his property. (Known as the Castle Law - as in a Man's Home is His Castle). Property lines becomes hazy with regards to river right-of ways (canoeing / kayaking) with some areas defining public right-of-way as the waterline, others as the flood-line. In general, as long as you stay in your boat, you should be able to pass through private land, but you might not be allowed to fish from their banks. Public Land : The rules concerning public land vary between agencies. State Parks, State Forests, National Parks, National Monuments, National Forests, BLM (Bureau of Land Management) Land, National Wildlife Refuges, National Grasslands... etc. Even Within each of these, there will be differences in what you are allowed to do. Wilderness , Primitive , Roadless are some of the different sub-sections you might find within a single National Forest, or National Park or BLM Land. Most regulations regard the usage of vehicles (where you can and can't drive) and camping. But some rules apply to hiking as well. The most restrictive are usually National Parks and Monuments - which often have permit systems for overnight hiking, and designated camping areas. National Forests vary widely on whether you need a permit or not, especially concerning Wilderness areas, which might limit usage / group size to protect the resource. These might also include where you can camp (distance from bodies of water) whether you can have camp fires, etc... or even whether you need a permit. These regulations vary by National Forest. Generally, however, on non-Wilderness , National Forest or BLM land, you are free to travel on any established, marked road, and camp in any established dispersed camping area (ie, one already barren and obviously been used for camping). Limits on how long you are allowed to stay exist (usually 14 days). Conclusion: The US has an awesome system of public lands (quite possibly the country's most redeeming property). However, the right to roam (or the regulation against) varies widely. Check with the local Public Land's office when you arrive in an area to determine what is or is not allowed. (And why... Surprisingly, most of the rules are in place to help protect the resource from over-use, not to ruin your trip.) As for whether these rules are a ""bureaucratic formality"": No . Ignoring the regulations are a tickit-able misdemeanor that carries the same weight as a traffic violation, punishable by fines and jail time. In reality, most carry a modest fine, but failure to pay can result in your arrest. And, as is the case with all laws in the US - Ignorance of the law is no excuse for violating it.",when you arrive in an area,0.383945912,2499,2525,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1819

If you're out of coverage, the phone will keep searching for network and battery will die as quick as a cat fight. Of course you can use the airplane mode but we all know how long they last. GPS watches do last a long time. It will vary a bit from brand/model to brand/model. I picked randomly 4 Garmin ones and I got from 1 year for the simplest one up to 3 weeks (watch mode) / up to 8 hours (GPS mode) for the mid range one Up to 50 hours (GPS mode) / 2 weeks (sensor mode) / 5 weeks (watch mode) to the top model. So you could make usage of a full on all features on for to long. A dedicated GPS unit / handheld device picking 4 randomly similar low, mid and top range, all work on AA batteries and last for 25 hours (besides the top range that comes with a removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack and last for 14 hours.) But even lasting less than the watches you can easily carry another few batteries. Lasting 25 hours, you could easily have it on for a your whole walk (8 hour / day) for 3 days. I believe the trend is to build a device to suit a specific need. The watches are good for short trips running while GPS devices are more long trips. As a side note. I bought one of those portable solar panels (Go Zero, I don't remember the model) to try to recharge things. I think it was a waste of money.

The only downside to wearing a helmet is that it is slightly less comfortable than climbing without one, but this is a small price to pay for potentially saving your life or that of your climbing partner. I always wear one outside and would not let anyone who was not wearing a helmet belay me since they would be more likely to drop me if they were hit by a rock. Helmets are also useful if you are climbing a route and do not notice the rock outcropping above your head until you bang your head into it as I do on occasion :-) A recent event that occurred at one of my local crags illustrated the importance of wearing a helmet. The climber in this incident dislodged a dinner plate sized rock that was several inches thick and it hit his belayer on the head. Fortunately, she was wearing a helmet and survived despite being knocked unconscious. The climber was saved from decking by a attentive bystander who had the presence of mind to grab the rope. (This also suggests that it may be a good idea to belay with an assisted braking device in addition to wearing a helmet but that's a separate topic.)

Regardless of the tree diameter, it is, however, a good idea to use tree protectors. It could be either specialized gear that comes with the slackline, or just a piece of fabric to put in between the line and the tree.

309,,"When rock climbing, what is the difference between top-roping and leading?",the rope isn't always above the climber,"Top Roping: Top roping has an anchor at the top of the climb. The rope goes from the belayer at the bottom, all the way up to the top, through the anchor, and back down to the climber. If the climber falls, he or she only falls they only drop a little bit, provided the belayer has taken up all the slack. Additionally, the belayer pulls the rope up and brings it in to take up slack on the climber. Top roping is most definitely the way to go for a beginner. Lead Climbing: With lead climbing, the rope isn't always above the climber. Using fall protection either attached permanently to the wall, or placed by the climber, the climbing climbs, and periodically clips the rope into the protection as he or she ascends. If the climber falls, they will fall a distance equal to twice their height above their last placed anchor, plus the amount that the rope stretches, which may be a significant distance. Opposite to top-roping, in lead climbing the climber pulls the rope up, and the belayer lets the rope out to allow the climb.",the rope isn't always above the climber,0.235586569,495,534,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/309

That includes places where deer go to scrape the velvet off their horns when the horns are growing, like aspen groves. Snow will help, as long as the antlers are on top and not buried, at the same time sheds will eventually become bleached and then blend into the snow, while sticking out like a sore thumb in areas with dead/brown grass.

19692,,When and why were House Sparrows originally brought to the United States?,1851,"It looks like the first sparrows where brought over in 1851, to control insects, and because they would have been familiar to people coming from Europe. When Europeans first arrived in the Americas, there were Native American cities, but none of the species Europeans had come to expect in cities: no pigeons, no sparrows, not even any Norway rats. Even once European-style cities began to emerge, they seemed empty of birds and other large animals. In the late 1800s, a variety of young visionaries, chief among them Nicholas Pike, imagined that what was missing were the birds that live with humans and, he thought, eat our pests. Pike, about whom little is known, introduced about 16 birds into Brooklyn. Interestingly, when the first birds were released in Brooklyn, New York, in 1851, they were legally protected. However, as they became more abundant, and people began to see them as pests, they lost their protected status. Animal Diversity , Conservation Status When first introduced into the United States in 1851, house sparrows were protected from predators and fed. However, populations expanded enormously in North America and they were soon considered a nuisance species. Since the 1960's, with the changes in farming to larger, single crop farms, populations have declined. They are not, however, seen as threatened and are not included in most Canadian and U.S. regulations. The Story of the Most Common Bird in the World Reasons given for introduction were to establish wildlife familiar to European immigrants, or to control insect infestations. However, in agricultural areas, an average of 60% of the House Sparrows' diet consists of livestock feed (corn, wheat, oats, etc.), 18% cereals (grains from fields and in storage), 17% weed seeds, and only 4% from insects. Urban birds tend to eat more commercial birdseed, weed seed (e.g., crabgrass), and human scraps. House Sparrow History English house sparrows were first brought to New York around 1850. At the time, the city was facing a serious quandary: The snow-white linden moth was defoliating Manhattan Island, devouring its fruit trees and its leafy elms. City planners hoped that the sparrows would see the linden moth larvae as an all-you-can-eat buffet . And they did.

This may affect your decision on the ""right piece of land"" as much as weather can. Ideally, you would want to construct your shelter in an area that can withstand mother nature but this depends on many factors. A Few Factors to consider Weather - Direction of incoming weather. Tropical storms? Hurricanes? Terrain - Is the island flat? Can you take shelter in a cave (beware of animals, thanks @njzk2)? Climate Zone - are you located in a temperate climate? Resources - can you build a strong structure that can withstand the weather? If so, you may want to build in an area that can also help with visual distress signaling.

Why the latter? Think about how most people hike - usually focused downward, a few feet ahead on the trail, watching their footing to try to avoid a face plant. If you're headed downhill, you'll generally see some distance ahead of you on the trail at the same time as you're looking down to where you will set your feet the next step or two. You'll see any hiker coming up hill well in advance of meeting. On the other hand, if you're hiking uphill, and looking down at the trail, your range of vision is really just a few feet in front of you. Clearly the hiker going downhill has the visual advantage, and time, to adjust his position so the uphill hiker can pass. And, it's a lot easier for the downhill hiker to stop and resume than it is for the uphill hiker. Think about the interstate trucker or you on a bike - it takes more energy and time to restore speed if starting from a dead stop. So it is with the uphill hiker, especially if carrying a backpack - let her come on through so she can benefit from the ""body in motion"" principle in physics. This applies to hikers running downhill too. And just because you're running downhill (nobody is impressed anyway, and secretly hoping you face plant) that doesn't give you the right of way. From Lowergear - Who has the ""Right-of-Way""? Further citation: On a narrow pass, hikers going uphill have the right of way.

You can read the full article at Australia Sailing yourself, I will just summarize it. When on a boat and the winds are gaining in intensity, this will have the effect of adding power to your sails, which adds speed. At the same time, the higher winds will increase the heel of your boat, which takes speed away and makes the helm unbalanced. When the heel exceeds a few degrees, the net effect is negative, and you need to de-power your sails.

5547,,When (if ever) do backcountry campsites in the major Canadian national parks in the Rocky Mountains grow quiet?,June,"I live in Banff National Park and go backcountry camping on a regular basis. Peak season for Banff, Kootenay, Jasper, Glacier, Yoho, and Revelstoke (and really, pretty much any Canadian National Park) are July and August. That said, it's also usually the best time to camp, as the weather is mild, the trails are at their best, and there is less chance of rain. Before I answer your question, It's worth pointing out that of the 3 million that visit Banff, 80% don't leave the town. Most of the rest camp at the major campgrounds and visit the major sites. Not a lot of people do any backcountry camping and you can usually book your site without any problem 48 hrs in advance, usually on a first come, first serve basis. To answer your question, the best quiet time is shoulder-season, especially after Labour Day (first Monday in September). Tourists will all be back at work/school with the exception of seniors and families with small children, neither of which are prime backcountry campers. The advantages of September: no crowds still relatively warm temperatures in the day, but not excessively hot. excellent trail conditions Chance to see the larches change colour at higher altitudes The disadvantages of September: cooler evenings in the rockies means you'll need a warmer sleeping bag. risk of snowfall (I've had 10 cm of snow on Sept 3rd, and then 27c on Sept 24th) June would be my second choice for shoulder-season backcountry camping, but it has several additional disadvantages: it's more likely to rain (we call it Monsoon June here in Banff) trails are more likely to be muddy because of May/June rain Often trails on southern aspects will still have snowcover on them Higher altitude routes might still have significant snow cover, obscuring trails/routes. Washed out bridges won't have been maintained yet. Having said all that, the best time for conditions, at least for Banff/Jasper is the last 2-3 weeks of August.

19913,,Where does lightning strike,from the clouds to the ground,"Lightening strikes from a point of excess electrons (negatively charged) to a path to a deficit of electrons (positively charged). As a rule, lightening usually strikes from the clouds to the ground, but occasionally, the opposite can happen as well. It is not always the case that the tallest object will be struck. The path which offers least resistance to ground will be struck, and that may not necessarily be through the tallest object. The reason is that the tallest object might be in the path along which lightning finds to be a less attractive path to ground, or an alternative path than the tallest object might be closer. As a hypothetical example, if there was a rubber tree that stood 100' tall, next to a live tree which stood 50' tall, the taller tree has less of a chance of being struck, because it is negatively charged (has excess electrons), while the shorter tree is positively charged (has a deficit of electrons) thereby creating a better path to ground. Thus, the live tree - while shorter - is the more dangerous place to be. For this reason, tall objects are ""grounded"". This means, there is material at the top of a tall object - like a building - connected to the ground by means of a wire or structure. What will happen is lightning will find the route to ground to be more attractive by going through the wire or structure, rather than through the building. That is why the building you may be in can be struck, and you won't be hurt. There are a few parallel examples in life which illustrate this phenomenon. One is the example of a person parking their car in a parking lot. Two cars parked next to each other present an opportunity for either to be broken into - or stolen. The car which offers the best opportunity to be broken into for its contents will be the mark - and that could be both cars. The car which offers best opportunity to be stolen will be the mark - and that will usually be one car. If you have a convertible, best not park next to another convertible, since both cars are more attractive to a thief looking for cars or contents. Best is to park close to the store, or near a security camera. If you drive a Mercedes, best not to park next to a Ford Pinto unless you park close to the store. The safe bet is to park close to the store. A thief will find an easier mark, just like lightning will choose a path of least resistance. The other example is oddly apropos to this group: How does one outrun a bear? The answer is: you don't have to outrun a bear, you need only run faster than the person next to you. The slower person will be more attractive to the bear than you.

17040,,Where do white tigers live?,zoos,"All white tigers live in zoos. The last white tiger living in the wild was shot in 1958. (This breaks my heart.) From a-z animals : White Tiger Classification and Evolution The White Tiger (also known as the White Bengal Tiger) is a subspecies of Tiger, found throughout the Indian subcontinent. Although the range of the White Tiger is historically very large, these animals are incredibly rare as their colouration is dependent on a defective, recessive gene that is passed on from their parents. A fellow cat-lover sent me an e-mail nearly two months ago about a ""pale tiger"" that had just been photographed in the wild. From The Guardian : Animal spotted by photographer in jungles of southern India may be the fairest known tiger living outside captivity. Pale tigers, distinct from white tigers, are thought to have a genetic mutation that results in what biologists call colour morphism. It occurs in environments with large, random mating pools that allow for the varied exchange of genes. Parvish Pandya, a doctor of zoology, said the birth of a tiger with pale fur was ‚Äúquite a genetic chance‚Äù. He ruled out the possibility the tiger was albino, citing the lack of pinkish hue around its eyes. Wright, who has spent decades in India tracking tigers, said she recalled only ever seeing one before, in the Ranthambore national park in Rajasthan in the 1980s. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt nearly as pale as this one,‚Äù she said. The last white tiger in the wild was shot in 1958, and though some still live in public and private zoos, many suffer severe health problems due to a lack of genetic mixing.

10429,,Where do you place ice screws?,curtains or pillars,"Good Ice Sounds obvious, but that's the answer, you need to learn how to identify good solid ice for all your screw placements. The best ice is the thickest ice you can find, so you can place your longest screws; clear and blue will be the most solid, while the worst ice is cloudy or brown, full of bubbles (aerated) and 'crunches' when you poke it, or has water flowing through or under it. You can test ice by gently tapping it and listening to the sound, but don't hit it hard enough to weaken it. The temperature plays a huge part in the quality of ice as well; -10¬∞C (¬±5¬∞C) is the best temperature for ice climbing, warmer temperatures mean softer ice, and colder temperatures mean harder, more brittle ice. What features should you look for? Thick slabs of solid ice stuck to rock. Don't place ice screws on curtains or pillars, this can be to your detriment, if you're climbing some hanging ice that happens to cleave from the wall while you're still on it, then being bolted to that falling ice could kill you, It's best to wait until you climb up to where the ice is secured to the rock above to place your first screw. Be sure to use a screamer or reusable shock absorber for your first screw, as well as over any over-hangs, and angle your screws about 10¬∞ up into the ice, tests have shown that screws have better holding power when angled up a bit.

What is letterboxing? It's most commonly practised (and originally started) in Dartmoor, and shares a lot of things with geocaching. It originally started with just a handful of boxes on the most remote parts of the moor, and a postcard would be left by the person visiting in the box. They would take the postcard they found, write a little message then send it on its way. These days that has mainly been forgotten - instead each box has a rubber stamp, and you collect impressions of these as you find the boxes. You also have a personal stamp which you use to assert you've visited the box. What are the differences with geocaching? Aside from the stamps, letterboxes also don't tend to contain tradeable items as geocaches do. If you find a letterbox with a rubber stamp, DO NOT take it and swap it for something else! I've seen a few letterboxes where someone's written in the log something like ""left keyring, took duck stamp, TFTC!"". Not only is this annoying it shows a complete disregard for the hobby and annoys letterboxers no end. Other differences include: There's no minimum distance between letterboxes, indeed it's common to find 2 right next to each other! While some letterboxes have 10 fig. grid references that can be used sensibly with a GPS, most don't, and usually with letterboxes you have to use a map and compass to triangulate yourself manually. It takes longer and requires more skill, but because of this I find it more satisfying when you find it! There's no centralised map / database for letterboxes like there is for geocaches - while there are electronic forms of the catalogue with updates, these are via email, and the normal way is to order a copy of the paper catalogue which you have to do the old fashioned way - see here for details. They come out twice annually at around the time the clocks change (in the UK). How do I find letterboxes in my area? So to answer the more specific question therefore about where you can find information on geocaches in your area, look at the catalogue! It has a specific section at the back where you can view all boxes in each 1km grid square which is what you can use for finding all the boxes in a specific area. The other thing to bear in mind is that there are many, many more caches around than are in the catalogue - no-one knows exactly how many are out there, but chances are you will stumble across some by accident that won't be in there. Still mark them down, they still count!

So if a customer purchases 5 bottles of polar pure we would ship 1 each day and the customer would receive 1 each day as well.

An emergency tourniquet is generally used as a last resort, especially in civilian applications, for all blood flow below the application of an emergency tourniquet is stopped, and can subsequently kill the tissue, leading to eventual loss of the limb below application. Never attempt to apply a tourniquet unless you are qualified to do so. A tourniquet is a last resort to stop bleeding and is used to save life at possible loss of limb. Where: place a 2 inch or wider tourniquet 2-4 Inches from the wound towards the heart. Never wrap your tourniquet directly around a wound, fracture, or joint. Doing so may cause severe pain and permanent physical damage to the patient. Place some sort of padding underneath the tourniquet and wrap the tourniquet material around the limb several times. Use a torsion device such as a strong stick-like instrument that is 1 foot or longer. Tie an overhand knot over your torsion device, and then tie another. This will ensure that you have reached the torsion necessary to stop the bleeding entirely. Tighten the torsion device by twisting it in one direction until the material is tight around the limb and/or the bright red bleeding has stopped. Tie the loose ends of the tourniquet around the ends of the torsion device. This will help to ensure that your tourniquet does not loosen. Please do understand that Two hours is considered the length of time a tourniquet can be in place before neuromuscular injury and functional loss begin. For applications longer than 2 hours, cooling the limb may help delay injury and loss of function. The best method to save a limb is rapid transport and converting to a less-damaging means of hemorrhage control as soon as practicable. [Walters TJ, Mabry RL.

Avoid impermeable surfaces like granite slabs, because your rinse water will run off and end up contaminating a much larger surface area than if it can percolate down into a permeable material. As you mention, large, clean, flat rocks nearby can make organization easier, but I would try to avoid accumulating food particles in the open to get ""munched up"".

The Gov website doesn't list where you can or cannot trap signals, as you need landowners and angling club permission to trap on our lakes and rivers. If you trap crayfish without written permission you could be prosecuted. Bonus however of the fact that the crayfish licence is free currently. For the traps you must follow the guidelines set out by Gov. Crayfish trap rules There are strict rules about the design and size of crayfish traps because they can harm other wildlife. If traps are the wrong size or design your application will be refused. Traps must: be no longer than 600mm be no wider than 350mm at the widest point have an entrance no more than 95mm wide have mesh no bigger than 30mm at its widest point have EA identity tags You must: tell EA or NRW about crayfish you trap using a catch return form (you get the form when you‚Äôre authorised) return species not covered by consent to the water they came from As for the native species, these can be trapped soley for scientific research, and you again require written authorisation to do so. If you trap by accident simply return to the water where you found it, there won't be harm to them if they are trapped by accident, they just get a free meal off you.

I've been to southern, central, and northern Norway, as well as to central and northern Sweden and northern Finland. Broadly speaking, the mountains look roughly similar, but with significant differences, so whether the other mountains are ""like that of Abisko"" is subjective.

The National Park Service website has good information and safety recommendations. Each year a number of visitors are injured by wildlife. There are multiple entrances to the park, and lodging opportunities both inside and outside the park. Regardless of where you stay, you will do a considerable amount of driving travel in Yellowstone - it's huge and you won't simply park and see everything. We stayed outside the park, and made sure we had plenty of gas for each day. Beyond the simple mileage, you can be caught in ""animal traffic jams"" for significant periods of time. This can be either simply stuck as a herd of animals block the road, or stuck in long lines of cars who are looking at animals. Rangers will generally arrive soon to move things along, but it can take a while. We were stuck for 30 minutes for people stopping to watch geese. As you mention you're disabled, these locations offer plenty of opportunity from the road and comfort of your car or near to it. Some people bring binoculars or spotting scopes, and they're often willing to share if you don't have your own. Many locations also have good boardwalks, paved paths, or well maintained gravel pathways if you are in a wheelchair. There are many marked and unmarked driving pull-outs through out the park.

Normal circulation relies on some movement of the legs to keep blood moving effectively. Simply standing or sitting still for long periods can cause problems. It is not that uncommon for soldiers to faint on parades when standing still for long periods. Clearly being suspended by leg loops greatly exacerbates this especially as the femoral artery, one of the largest blood vessels in the body is quite close to the surface around the inner thigh. Being unconscious makes the situation worse as the victim is unable to move or transfer their weight eg to an improvised foot loop but even when conscious the fundamental problem still exists. Also the waist belt can put pressure on the abdomen constricting the diaphragm and making breathing more difficult. The net result is that the heart has to work much harder to circulate blood as it is fighting both against gravity and the restriction around the thighs plus any other shock and trauma which occurred during the initial fall. To put it another way blood tends to pool in the lower body. Which has a knock-on effect for blood flow and thus oxygen supply to the brain. There is also a potential issue that when blood flow is restored to a limb which has been restricted accumulated toxins can overwhelm the body's ability to deal with them potentially causing organ damage. This can also happen with crush injuries.",blood vessels in the body is quite close to the surface around the inner thigh,0.004082057,918,996,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15808

They think it's beneficial to the beginner climber, but consistency is more important. Where I worked (in Seattle, WA) the grades would always stiffen back up when the setters got back outside in the summer, and soften a bit over the winter.

14690,0,Why does hop always grow clockwise?,"Some vines spiral in the right-handed sense, others left","There are quite a few plants like this. It's coded into their DNA. Some vines spiral in the right-handed sense, others left, e.g., morning glory and honeysuckle go the opposite way. There can also be a screw-handedness in various other things like the way the leaves are arranged around the stalk or the organization of petals into flowers. Similarly, humans have their liver on the right and heart on the left, our brain hemispheres are asymmetric, and so on. The asymmetry also exists on the molecular level in all forms of life. For example, the molecule that gives spearmint its characteristic smell has a mirror-image version that exists in caraway seeds and has a different smell. Ultimately all of these asymmetries probably originated by chance at an early stage in the evolution of life on earth. They're coded in DNA, which is itself asymmetric. In terms of evolution, I think there are likely to be different reasons in different animals and plants why it's advantageous to have an asymmetry rather than symmetry. Then if asymmetry is advantageous, it's probably random which of the two occurs. I googled for info on vines, but mainly found only info on animals . So the following is just my speculation, but I would think that in the case of a climbing vine, it would be advantageous for it to have a definite screw-sense programmed into it, because it makes it more likely that it will actually form a spiral, thereby staying firmly attached to the thing it's climbing up. If it didn't have a handedness, then it could kind of randomly start going up one way, then turn the other, and the result might be that it would sort of zigzag back and forth without ever securely wrapping around.",one way,0.00312374,1564,1571,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14690

5861,0,Why does sunscreen not work all day?,"they will rub off faster when exposed to water/moisture, most commonly from sweating or swimming","All sunscreens are physical barriers, designed to absorb or reflect UV radiation. They rub off over time, and they will rub off faster when exposed to water/moisture, most commonly from sweating or swimming. Friction (e.g. from towel-drying) also removes sunscreen. Some chemical sunscreens do break down when exposed to sunlight and require the addition of other chemicals as stabilizers. This is less of a concern with mineral (zinc or titanium oxide) sunscreens. The most common recommendation is to reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours, but this doesn't take into account many variables such as individual sun-sensitivity, SPF of the sunscreen, and type/level of activity. So the 2-3 hour guideline is a blanket recommendation that won't necessarily prevent one from burning. In fact, a 2001 study suggests that earlier re-application is more effective: Advice given to sunscreen users should be to apply sunscreen liberally to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun, followed by reapplication of sunscreen to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes after sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary after vigorous activity that could remove sunscreen, such as swimming, towelling, or excessive sweating and rubbing. As for claims of all-day (or x-hour) protection, time estimates are based on a rough calculation using SPF. According to the Environmental Working Group , SPF is a measurement of sunburn protection, primarily caused by UVB rays. If your skin would normally burn after 10 minutes in the summer midday sun, for example, wearing a thick layer of an SPF 15 sunscreen would theoretically allow you to stay in the sun for 150 minutes (10 x 15) without burning. This is a rough estimate, however, and your own skin, the type of activities you do in the sun (e.g. involving water or sweat) and the intensity of sunlight may affect how much safety it gives you. SPF ratings can be confusing or misleading. The numbers do not reflect the degree of protection from UVA rays, which cause skin aging, immune suppression and cancer. The FDA has warned that high-SPF products can create a false sense of security, contain higher concentrations of allergenic or irritating ingredients and offer little additional sun protection (Branna 2011). Moreover, manufacturer claims are likely based on a best-case scenario that would involve applying a thick layer ~20 minutes before going outdoors to allow for the lotion to bind to the skin, minimal sweating and friction, and perhaps even use of additional protection measures such as a hat or umbrella.",Friction,0.013969881,208,216,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5861

11100,,Why are people so worried about Giardia?,hand-to-mouth contamination,"The question doesn't state what geographical area it's about, and it really isn't possible to give an answer that covers everything. In this answer, I'm only going to deal with pristine backcountry areas in North America, such as the Sierra. In order to interpret the scientific evidence properly, it's necessary to understand some scientific background about Giardia and giardiasis. The human gut is naturally teeming with microorganisms. These are known as your gut flora or gut microbiome. Most of these are bacteria, but quite a few are other organisms, including protozoans such as Giardia. Some of these critters in your intestines are beneficial or even necessary for your metabolism, while others may be neutral or harmful. People tend to develop tolerance for their own gut flora, but can get sick from other people's. The gut microbiome tends to be more diverse among people in the developing world, less so in the developed world, and this decreased diversity may actually be a bad thing. Giardia is present in about 3-7% of adults in the US, about 30% in the developing world.[Auerbach 2012] Among toddlers in the US, roughly a third have it.[Ish-Horowicz 1989] Most people who have Giardia as part of their gut flora have no symptoms at all, which is why you don't see a third of toddlers with miserable cases of diarrhea at any given time. Among people who do have symptoms, the condition is normally mild and self-limiting. For unknown reasons, there is a small portion of the population that tolerates Giardia badly if newly introduced to it, and these people have unpleasant diarrhea for some period of time. Giardia is present in surface water in the form of dormant cysts. These cysts tend to resist being killed by chlorine. You can pick up Giardia by drinking water that contains cysts, but what was not realized in the 1970s, during the initial Giardia public-health panic, was that Giardia is also transmissible through hand-to-mouth contamination. In the context of backpacking, this would something like the following. A and B go backpacking together. A has Giardia in her gut microbiome, and she tolerates it and has never had any symptoms. B doesn't have it. A poops and doesn't wash her hands, and then A and B have dinner together and share pots and pans. B eats food that is contaminated with A's Giardia. Many people use Giardia as a sort of generic term, like ""xerox"" or ""kleenex."" For this reason, it is common to hear backpackers claim that they ""got Giardia,"" when all they really know is that they got sick. They could have had some other condition, they could have had giardiasis but contracted it somewhere else, or they could have gotten a bug through hand-to-mouth contamination from their hiking partners. Often people will make this claim when they got sick during the hike. This is unlikely. When an animal is infected by a parasite, there's a prepatent period, which is the time from infection with a parasite to when the bugs reach a life stage where they can be detected by a lab test. There's also an incubation period, which is the time from infection to symptoms. For most parasites, the prepatent period is shorter than the incubation period, but for Giardia it's often longer. A 1954 study on prison volunteers showed an average prepatent period of 9 days, but there's a wide range of variation, and the incubation period can be as long as months. In a study of travelers to the Soviet Union, the typical time until acute symptoms occurred was found to be a couple of weeks. In about two thirds of patients, the prepatency period was longer than the incubation period by a week or more. In summary, if someone gets backpacker's diarrhea while on a weekend backpacking trip, it's very unlikely that it was caused by giardiasis that they acquired during the trip. As stated above, my answer only deals with pristine backcountry areas in North America. Some studies have surveyed water in these areas for Giardia.[Suk 1986],[Jaret 2003] The water was extremely clean, and huge volumes of it had to be filtered in order to pick up any detectable number of Giardia cysts. For example, there were sites in the Sierra where they filtered 100 gallons of water and didn't detect a single Giardia cyst left over in the filter. In most of the locations where cysts were detected, the concentrations were so low that they have to be expressed in scientific notation. In low-use areas, they ranged from zero to about 5x10^-3 per liter, while one high-use area had about 0.1 per liter. Elsewhere in the U.S., similar testing also found extremely low concentrations all of the backcountry locations tested: West Beaver Creek, AZ; Merced River, CA; Chattooga River, NC; Neversink River, NY; White Pine Lake, UT; Greenwater River, WA; and Renard Lake, WI. From these studies, it appears that if you spend a weekend drinking untreated water in pristine backcountry areas in the US, you will typically not ingest a single Giardia cyst. We then need to do a risk-benefit analysis. This raises the question of how many cysts you need to swallow in order to have a certain chance of getting infected, as well as the chance that this will cause symptoms. The best single source of information on the first question is a 1954 study by Rendtorff that used prison volunteers; the data are summarized and analyzed further by [Cox 2002] and [Rose 1991]. Roughly speaking, you have to ingest about 20-30 cysts to be likely to get an infection. It would be interesting to know whether there is a threshold effect, i.e., whether or not there is some chance, however small, of getting sick by swallowing a single cyst. The data are not sufficient to determine this. Rose introduces a mathematical model in which it is assumed that each cyst has some probability p of setting up shop in your gut, but this is an assumption of the model, and is not testable based on the data, which used higher doses. Rose's model is also not consistent with data showing that even when people drink very highly contaminated water, there is still only about a 50% chance of contracting giardiasis.[Wilkerson 1992] In this type of study, one of the confounding factors is that the minimum infectious dose can vary depending on the strain of the microorganism. If you do pick up a giardia infection, and if you weren't already an asymptomatic carrier, then it appears that your chance of developing symptoms is about one in 10.[Wilkerson 1992] Based on these numbers, we can make at least a rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the risk associated with drinking backcountry water. Suppose you go on a weekend hiking trip in the Sierra and drink 6 liters of untreated water. In low-use areas, the concentration of Giardia cysts in your water appears to average about 3x10^-3 per liter. Based on Rose's model, take the probability of infection to be about p=.02 per cyst. If infection occurs, the chance of getting symptoms (which are in most cases mild) is on the order of 0.1. Multiplying these factors, we arrive at a probability of about 4x10^-5 that you will get Giardia symptoms. That is, under these assumptions, out of a million people who do this, about 40 are expected to get diarrhea. This estimate appears to conflict with a study by Zell,[Zell 1993] which states: The incidence of Giardia cyst acquisition in backcountry travelers was only 5.7% (95% CI 0.17‚Äì20.2%). Mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal illness occurred in 16.7% of subjects (95% CI 4.9%‚Äì34.50%), none of whom demonstrated G. lamblia infection. Although none of the people in the study who had Giardia got symptoms, this rate of infection is many orders of magnitude higher than would have been expected from water contamination based on the Rendroff-Rose data and modeling. Unfortunately the Zell article is paywalled, so I can only see the abstract, but it appears that he would have had no way to tell whether the people who acquired infections got them from contaminated water or from hand-to-mouth contamination. In any case, Zell's conclusion is that water treatment is of marginal cost-effectiveness, given the low risk and the fact that the infection is self-limiting and usually asymptomatic. Another reality check we can do is to compare the concentrations of Giardia in backcountry water with the concentrations in city tap water. This is complicated by the fact that Giardia cysts, whether found in backcountry water or tap water, may be nonviable, and surveys cannot usually determine their viability. Historically, city tap water has been getting cleaner and cleaner, especially in the developed world. However, it appears to have been normal in 20th-century America for city tap water to contain concentrations of Giardia cysts that are similar to or greater than the concentrations found in backcountry areas of the US.[Rockwell 2002] It would be interesting to get more detailed information on this from someone who has professional-level knowledge of US water supplies and their history. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2000 concluded that ""the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal.""[Welch 2000] When people do actually contract backpacker's diarrhea from exposure during a hiking trip, by far the most common reason is hand-to-mouth contamination.[Welch 1995] Auerbach 2012 - Paul S.

When putting a tent up you may have a bundle of fabric that you need to set down on an uneven surface, sort and erect. Having it in black distinguishes it from the varied colours of the tent walls so you can always place your tent floor down, without having to check all the sections. The floor is the strongest, most heavily waterproofed part of the tent skin, so this also means you are less likely to end up with a damp tent from placing it upside-down on damp ground, or tears from catching branches or roots on a thin piece of tent fabric. Found another reason: Because the floor is manufactured using a different process to the rest of the tent, making floors that matched the tops would require more complicated processes and cost more. A constant black means any floor can be fixed to a top of the correct size.","The floor is the strongest, most heavily waterproofed part of the tent skin",0.050673753,380,455,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14024

15552,,Why do horses need to wear shoes?,slows the wear and tear horses get on their hooves,"There are a few reasons why horses need (and in some cases need not to wear shoes). Weak hooves / easily cracked or damaged, or mentality. Some horses are prone to easily damaging their hooves. We had one pony who had worn shoes his whole life (he was around 14 when we brought him) and when his shoes were removed he had trouble walking and even over a space of 2-3 weeks was so distressed with lack of shoes the farrier had to come out and put the fronts back on (he had to not have rears due to stable rules but he managed fine with just fronts!). Wearing shoes slows the wear and tear horses get on their hooves. Stability. Shoes for domestic / competition horses can come with stud holes. You use studs in bad weather, over the winter, in poor ground conditions. They are little bullet like screw in bits of metal that help the horse get grip in the bad conditions. This makes it harder to walk on the flat but are often used in Cross Country or sponsored rides in the winter seasons. I used these when I competed, when not in use you put a stud plug or some cotton wool in the hole. Management (this is a sort of side effect that's useful). All horses, even 'wild' ones need a way to care for their hooves. Shoes have a sort of bonus in so far as you really can tell when the farrier needs to come give them a trim! The 'wild' Dartmoor ponies even get rounded up once a year to have a trim because overgrown hooves can leave horses unable to walk. Reason NOT to shod a horse - safety for other horses or humans. Imagine being kicked by a steel toe capped boot... but harder. Horse shoes come along the lines of wearing shoes as humans, all a hoof is is a giant nail which needs trimming and care (You do yours don't you?). Domestic horses should be re-shod or have their hooves filed every 4-6 weeks to maintain their hooves unless they throw a shoe.

You don't have to tell people that you hit a rock. They will hear, even over the roar. It's cold. If you spend time on your knees in your canoe, you will want to install foam kneelers. It's also grabby. Aluminum sticks to rocks. It dents. Bring your automotive dent kit. Mind you, it will take huge amounts of abuse and still be usable. Until the Discovery series came out, aluminum was popular with canoe rentals. Customers couldn't hurt them much that couldn't be fixed with a wooden block and a hammer, and a can of spray paint. The Discovery didn't get so banged up looking, and was still cheap. The downside was greater weight at 80 some pounds. In terms of production it's expensive to set up. Grumman cornered the aluminum canoe market because they were set up to make airplanes. Making a plug for a cloth/resin lay up is a few hundred dollars. Making the jigs for stamping aluminum run about 100K a set, and it takes at least 2 sets to make a canoe, assuming bow/stern symmetry. Resin/fabric is the cheapest to set up. You also have the greatest control over the final shape of the hull. Compound curves are easy. Next cheapest is the cross linked CPVC (Discover series) You're working with a sheet, and deforming it, or making it in a rotational mold. Because of the thickness of the material, it makes for a much blunter end than a resin/fabric hull. (Old Town claims that the Discover series is made from a triple layer of polyethylene. Either they have changed, or my memory is bad. Probably the latter. I will re-edit if I can find out.) Royalex is a triple layer laminate. This makes it harder to work with.

22237,,Why is this woodchuck losing its fur?,hair seems blotchy because the new hair is brighter,"So having a quick read this could be a molting process. Many animals have summer / winter coats and Woodchucks / Groundhogs are one of these lucky creatures. Woodchucks have two layers of hair, the outer coat is made of course hair with a reddish-brown, gray, or white coloring. The inner layer is a soft hair of pale color and is used as insulation by the animal during hibernation. The legs and tail have a dark brown or black coloration to them, and the hair is very short. The belly is thinly lined with coarse hair but has no inner layer of insulation. So Woodchucks have a double layered coat - much like many dog breeds that molt - and in summer a double layer coat can get rather hot so usually it is shed in spring and grows again in autumn (or in some cases actually sheds again in autumn and the new coat comes up underneath). Some animals have a triple layer coat, which sheds in a similar manner. Shedding of fur is done annually and has been observed to happen in April, May, and June. The molting process begins at the tail and head at the same time. The molt progresses down from the head and up from the tail until it meets in the middle where it is completed. During this process hair seems blotchy because the new hair is brighter. If the hair however seems to be down to simply skin, that would be slightly different, and may require treatment, however the pictures match the above quote, with the hair mostly being left in the middle although the new hair looks very fine compared to the thick old hair.

1581,,Why do some knives have one-sided sharpening?,it lacks the hollow back and single flat bevel required,"Serrations are formed on one side due to the method of manufacture (a formed grinding wheel). I suppose it would be possible to grind serrations from both sides with very careful alignment but I cannot recall seeing this on any production knives. Single-side or ""chisel grind"" blades are not restricted to serrated knives. Nearly all traditional Japanese knives use this design: The single-edged blade is a unique feature of traditional Japanese knives directly linked to Japanese cuisine. Traditional Japanese cuisine aims to preserve and accentuate the true flavors of fresh and seasonal ingredients, and a sharp knife is essential to this process. To achieve their ""unforgettable sharpness,"" traditional knives are razor sharp on one side and slightly concave on the reverse side. This design creates an overall sharper cutting edge, makes resharpening easier, and allows for more sensitive culinary work. This design allows for easier hand sharpening (on a water stone) because of the construction. The back of the blade (called the ""ura"") is actually hollow, flattened at the perimeter, as seen on this chisel . (On knives the flattened area is much smaller and harder to see.) The front uses a very wide bevel. Each surface is placed flat on the stone to sharpen and acts as a natural guide, though much skill is still required. Here is an exaggerated-scale cross section: ( This one is more proportionate) It allows for a keener cutting edge on a knife of a given thickness. It also changes the way the knife cuts and the manner in which it is held. The steel used in these knives needs to be very hard to support the low angle edge but they are fragile as a result. Some manufacturers such as Emerson Knives use a single side grind, but it does not benefit from the method of sharpening that Japanese knives (and chisels) have because it lacks the hollow back and single flat bevel required. In use these knives ""steer"" to one side making it difficult to cut straight lines (in cardboard, for example). They also bite in asymmetrically, cutting in a shaving motion when held at a very low angle on one side, but requiring a much steeper angle on the other (typically much steeper than double sided blades). Further, these designs are usually ground on the left side of the knife (as typically are serrations on pocket knives), presumably for appearance when held in the right hand; this is actually backward for right-handed use in a normal grip. (Compare the traditional Japanese knives which have the bevel on the other side.) They are not keener (lower angle; thinner) than other pocket knives because the steel and their intended use will not support it. Because the edge angle is produced (almost) entirely by the bevel on one side the final bevel has to be about twice as steep as comparable blades (around 30¬∞). This causes problems for guided sharpening systems because they typically do not go up that high.",it lacks the hollow back and single flat bevel required,0.170887217,1843,1898,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1581
7530,,Why don't people in the UK use snowshoes?,lack of continuous snow and availability,"This is really interesting, and I think it might be similar to why we don't generally have snow tires / chains etc as a common item here in stores. Certainly the South rarely gets snow, with Wales, The North and Scotland being more likely to get snow days. From the MET Office: The UK gets on average 33 days of snow fall or sleet a year (1971 - 2000). Most of this is snow falling on higher ground where temperatures are lower. Also from the MET office: How much snow settles? Much of this snow fall does not settle, and the figures for snow on the ground (snow lying) are much lower. On average across the UK there's only 16.5 days a year when snow is on the ground, compared to 27.7 days in Scotland. Again, most of the snow on the ground can be found in mountainous areas. Without going too in depth into marketing... stores are very likely to sell what they know a consumer is likely to buy, and in numbers. If you'll note snow shovels and sledges turn up in UK stores in winter and certainly in the South they are plastic, and not likely to be used (or last if they are!).

8274,,Why might one need a 2000 lumen headlamp?,over 6000 mA,"Other answers have addressed the ""why"", but let's talk about the ""what's real"" regarding lumens. Before we get into calculation the actual output of this light (which is definitely nowhere near 2000 lumens), we need to understand what lumens are. Lumens is the SI unit for luminous flux, which is essentially the total amount of light in the visible spectrum emitted by a source in all directions. Lumens does not depend on distance from the light source, because it must be measured in all directions. A related unit, lux, measures light at a point, and is dependent on distance. 1 lux = 1 lm/m 2 . If you were to measure the lux at every point on an imaginary sphere around a light source, add them up, and multiply by the surface area of that sphere, you would get the total lumens output of the device. No matter what the diameter of the sphere, you would get the same number of lumens. As you increase the diameter, the lux measured at each point decreases, but the surface area and number of points you must measure at increase. It turns out this is almost exactly how you measure lumens in real life - with a scientific instrument called an integrating sphere . An integrating sphere uses a highly diffuse coating to evenly disperse light inside a sphere. All light entering through the sample port bounces around so many times that the brightness is nearly even at any point on the surface of the sphere. A photodetector, typically a radiometer, measures the intensity of the light received at the exit port across all visible wavelengths, then sums the intensities to determine the total luminous flux. Below is a photo of the integrating sphere I used to conduct testing of bike lights: The ANSI FL1 Standard specifies measurement procedures and reporting criteria for measuring the output (lumens), beam distance (calculated from lux), battery life, and other properties of flashlights, headlamps, bike lights, and other personal lighting equipment. This provides a repeatable, verifiable, and trustworthy way for lighting manufacturers to report device specifications. Most reputable personal lighting manufacturers follow this standard, but random generic manufacturers - like those selling the light mentioned in the question - do not. These generic sellers tend to drastically overstate and even outright lie about specifications, claiming insanely high lumen values with no data to back them up. So, now let's prove why this light doesn't put out 2000 lumens. It appears this light uses two 18650 batteries. The Panasonic NCR18650 PDF is one of the most common 18650 lithium battery cells, and is the cell used inside of many repackaged batteries sold by flashlight companies and inside many devices with integrated batteries. Its rated capacity is 2700 mAh and the nominal voltage is 3.6 V. For two batteries, that gives 9.7 Watt-hours . Let's look at the Cree XM-L T6 emitter, the LED specified for the product you mentioned. Cree's Data Sheet PDF gives luminous flux (lumens) data for up to 2000 mA current draw. The maximum forward current for this LED is 3000 mA. At 3000 mA the forward bias is 3.35 V, so the light would draw just about 10 W. With the batteries mentioned above, the light would last just under 1 hour, if we ignore the power consumed by the control electronics and any efficiency losses. How much light does the LED put out at 3000 mA? I plotted the luminous flux vs. current draw for the light, and fit a linear function to the data: At 3000 mA current, the maximum current for this emitter, the extrapolated luminous flux is 1000 lumens. To achieve 2000 lumens, the LED would require over 6000 mA, more than twice the maximum for this emitter. Keep in mind that the lumen values here are calculated estimates based on the emitter's specifications. They don't take into account losses due to reflector design and lens material. LEDs also drop in output when they get hot, and most cheap lights have poor temperature management. I run a bike light testing and review site called The Bike Light Database , and I've tested similar generic headlights like this one. I measured a nearly identical light with a Cree XM-L T6 emitter and the actual output was 600 lumens, half of its claimed 1200 lumens and less than a third of this headlamp's claimed 2000. So, to answer your question rather long-windedly, why a 2000 lumen headlamp? Well, it's simply not a 2000 lumen headlamp.",over 6000 mA,0.404970855,3625,3637,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8274

10223,,Why / when to limit how much you gather?,Take all you can carry,"(TL:DR -- The ""safe"" amount to harvest varies enormously with plant species and context. When in doubt, take 5% or less. 1/3 is probably safe for common, prolific species.) This rule is given out because if you harvest every fruit on a plant, you've stopped it from reproducing this year. You don't necessarily even have to harvest all the fruit, if the plant has a generally low seed-germination rate. It gets a little more complicated if you're harvesting things other than fruit, too: taking a wild carrot kills it outright, meaning that unless its seeds have already ripened and been dispersed, that's 100% of its reproductive capacity gone. Same, and even worse, for annual species harvested that way. In scientific collections, the general rule I was taught is to leave at least 95% of a population -- that is, to kill no more than 1 in 20 plants, or to strip no more than 5% of the population's reproductive capacity. This is a good solid rule, especially when you're dealing with relatively uncommon wild species or species that are slow to recover from harvest. Frankly, though, foragers shouldn't take any of those unless it's literally a matter of starvation. Elderberry* is neither rare nor slow to recover; it flowers and fruits prolifically, year after year. You could likely harvest a third of its fruit, or even more, without damaging the population's long-term reproductive capacity. Be careful to leave enough for the animals that depend on the fruits, though! Personally, I definitely won't take more than 1/3 of a native species population. All that said, there are some edible plants whose extirpation would be a public service. Look up your local noxious weeds, and harvest those to your heart's content. Take more than you need! Take all you can carry! Kill them off, please! Did you have any specific plants in mind, other than elderberry?

Add more birds (of any species) to the mix and it increases the confusion.

Of course, any costs of competition must be taken into account, and if the sandpipers' and plovers' food sources overlap this will be real.

Turkeys, he says, are naturally fearful of cats, which can be a threat to younger, smaller birds. So it‚Äôs likely that, when they came across a dead one in the road, they were very curious to see what was going on, and whether it was alive. At the same time, turkeys tend to follow a leader or two as they roam through suburban yards in search of food (they have a diet mostly of nuts, grains, and berries‚Äîno cats). So if one leader took it upon itself to march around the corpse and inspect it, it makes sense that the others would follow its lead, while keeping a safe distance from the fallen feline.

15608,,Why doesn't it snow much at -30 ¬∞C?,it isn't so much the temperature,"It's actually kind of the other way around, it's not that being too cold prevents snow from falling, it's that an absence of moisture in the air allows the atmosphere to cool. Low pressure systems bring with them (relatively) warm moist air which precipitates as snow. The clouds overhead act as a blanket, and keep the surface air warmer. When the low pressure systems, clouds, and warm moist air move on, it creates the perfect conditions for the temperatures to drop. Sometimes the warm air systems are replaced by cold air systems when the winds change directions. Where I live the temperature changes drastically when the winds change, on Saturday it was -20¬∞C when the wind was out of the North. A Chinook has blown in the past couple nights out of the West (air from the Pacific Ocean that's traveled over the mountains and warmed up because of adiabatic lapse rates) and now it's +12¬∞C.

Cold air holds less moisture than warm air, but it isn't so much the temperature that prevents it from snowing, the temperature of the air determines how much moisture the air can hold.

15801,,Why did people rub snow on frozen feet?,Rubbing will further damage already damaged tissues,"Was there any logic behind this practice (rubbing frostbite with snow)? Is this method encouraged / discouraged by modern medicine? According to Hypothermia, Frostbite and Other Cold Injuries: Prevention, Survival, Rescue ... By Gordon G. Giesbrecht, James A. Wilkerson, the treatment gained popularity in the Napoleonic Wars because rapid rewarming from open campfires or other sources of dry heat caused so much devastation.....Dry heat from ....open fires....cannot be controlled. Excessively high temperatures are usually produced, resulting in a combined burn and frostbite, a devasting injury that leads to far greater tissue loss. This treatment is not advocated by modern medicine. According to Survive Outdoors, Inc : Until the 1950‚Äôs frostbite treatment consisted of rubbing snow over the affected area. However in 1956, Merryman disproved this treatment intervention. He instead encouraged the public health service medical officer in Tanana, Alaska to try rapid re-warming, with great success--Hence, the beginning of a new and effective treatment for frostbite. Edit in response to comment from @imsodin , who said ""rapid re-warming could be misinterpreted"". True. The Mayo Clinic site says: Gently rewarm frostbitten areas. Soak hands or feet in warm water ‚Äî 99 to 108 F (37 to 42 C) ‚Äî for 15 to 30 minutes. If a thermometer isn't available, test the water by placing an uninjured hand or elbow in it ‚Äî it should feel very warm, not hot. The Mayo Clinic site also says: Don't rub the affected area and never rub snow on frostbitten skin. Thus, not only rubbing with snow, but rubbing with anything, is a no-no for frostbite. Rubbing will further damage already damaged tissues. Caveat: This answer does not attempt to describe the proper treatment of frostbite; for that, see What are the different stages of frostbite? .

17237,,Why is the European robin associated with winter?,Christianity,"Robins are an all year round bird in the UK: RSPB with its bright red breast it is familar throughout the year and especially at Christmas! Males and females look identical, and young birds have no red breast and are spotted with golden brown. So this proves, for those of a keen eye, that there's inherently nothing special about the Robin Male vs Female, only the juveniles have a different colouring, no changes throughout the seasons like some mammals, nothing. They're pretty dapper in their red chests all year. SoWhyDoI Although robin folklore existed for many years, the robin became far more widely associated with Christmas after it was depicted on Christmas cards in 19th century England; a tradition that has been retained to this day. Why are robins on Christmas cards? It‚Äôs all inspired by the robins who used to deliver the Christmas cards in 19th century Britain. In the 1800s, British postmen wore bright red uniforms. They wore red in honor of the crown since red is considered both a Royal color and an important color on the English flag. (Incidentally, this may also be one of the reasons why British post boxes were eventually standardized to be red). The postmen in their red-breasted coats resembled the much-loved British bird, the robin red-breast, earning Victorian postmen the nick-name: Robins. Ok so this is a nice piece of information I did not know - Posties have always had a nickname of sorts, and it could be a valid reason for why they are on Christmas cards etc around that time of year, however there are other speculations too. Christianity: Legend has it that the robin's redbreast gives it a direct link to Christianity. One fable suggests that when the baby Jesus was in his manger in the stable, the fire which had been lit to keep him warm started to blaze up very strongly. A brown robin, noticing that Mary had been distracted by the inn-keeper‚Äôs wife, placed himself between the fire and the face of baby Jesus. The robin fluffed out its feathers to protect the baby, but in so-doing its breast was scorched by the fire. This redness was then passed onto future generations of robins. Further reading: Saga website on Christianity and Robins I think as well one good idea about why they are on postcards is when we used to get a huge blanket of snow Mr Robin Redbreast would stand out against the bland colours of winter with his bright red feathers, the contrast looked good and someone painted it and... here we are!",Christianity,0.005607302,1648,1660,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17237

Because worms hibernate, the winter robins feed primarily on berries, found on trees and shrubs in the woods. The Ohio DNR Division of Wildlife lists robins as native to Ohio. Some migrators travel through but there is a population that overwinters, in both urban areas and woodlands. They're shy and not easy to spot, which is probably why you haven't seen them, but it's worth looking. It sounds like you're in a great spot!

ZPacks, Hyperlight Mountain Gear, Zimmerbuilt, Gossamer Gear, and many others manufacture packs out of Hybrid Cuben Fiber, Dimension Polyant X-Pac fabrics, or other waterproof materials. Even more mainstream manufacturers use a good deal of waterproof fabrics. Speaking anecdotally, my REI Flash 45 uses waterproof fabric for most of the pack body. However, there is more to waterproofing a pack than the fabrics. Even packs that use waterproof textiles are not sufficiently waterproof unless the seams are sealed. Moreover, water can enter through zippers or drawcord openings. There are some packs on the market designed not to need a liner or cover (the ZPacks Arc Blast, for example), but achieving this requires a number of design considerations. They must simplify construction to minimize the number and complexity of seams to seal, they must eliminate features that create entry points for water (like hydration hose ports and zippers), and they must use a rolltop closure to seal out water. On a simple ultralight pack, this isn't much of a compromise.

10553,,Why did the wolf-pack withdraw from attacking me?,the wolves decided that you were not suitable as prey,"So, first of all there is no alpha male ! An alpha male only exists in captive wolf packs but never ever in the wild. Further reading about this topic here for example. The pack you've encountered was a family of three (more likely in January) or two generations. The average pack consists of a family of 5‚Äì11 animals (1‚Äì2 adults, 3‚Äì6 juveniles and 1‚Äì3 yearlings) From Wikipedia What you've experienced is pretty normal for hungry wolves. It's categorized as a ""Non-rabid unprovoked predatory attack"" . Predatory attacks Unprovoked wolf attacks motivated by hunger are categorized as ""predatory"". In some such cases, a cautious wolf may launch ""investigative"" or ""exploratory"" attacks to test the victim for suitability as prey. As with defensive attacks, such attacks are not always pressed, as the animal may break off the attack or be convinced to look elsewhere for its next meal. In contrast, during ""determined"" predatory attacks, the victims may be repeatedly bitten on the head and face and dragged off and consumed, sometimes as far away as 1-2.5 km from the attack site, unless the wolf or wolves are driven off. From Wikipedia This publication contains everything you need to know. Page 16 is the part we are talking about here :) In some cases it has been suspected that the wolves are ""testing"" or investigating the person as potential prey, which can result in close approach, being knocked over, or bites. So, to answer the question ""Why did the wolf-pack withdraw from attacking me?"": the wolves decided that you were not suitable as prey (luckily). That was somewhat the easy part. I feel like you want to know why the wolves decided that you are not suitable, won't you? The problem is that we can't look in their heads and have no video etc. However, these are the key facts which make you suitable as a victim: Running Panicking (loosing the control over your emotions/fear) Appearing weak and small So, you've instinctively made everything right. As you've already guessed, you saved your life cause you've controlled your emotion (fear, panic etc.) but the most important thing is that you didn't run ! A few additional points While I asked plenty outdoormen, nobody had this experience. That's because attacks like these are extremely rare: In the half-century up to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, three in North America Over the course of next 30-40 minutes, he was gradually coming closer to me, step by step, but the closest he got was about 3 meters. He was growling, teeth out, he definitely looked ready to take a bite, had that pose where whole body is lowered (as a cat), getting ready to jump. It was trying to provoke you. It wanted to make you start to run what would've been your end :$. Height: 190 cm Weight: ~100 kg Is by far nothing which is considered as ""weak and easy to hunt"" by a wolf. Remember the ""Appearing weak and small""-part from above? A worldwide 2002 study by the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were children under the age of 18, especially under the age of 10. I only read it recently you are not supposed to (stare at) the wolf like that (as it is regarded as provocation). You are right but often it's a little bit misunderstood. You don't provoke the animal with a short staring - you've to actively stare the animal down . So, I don't believe that your staring was recognized as a provocation. As you've described, your region is quite used to the wolves around. Therefore habituation might apply. Habituation Wolf attacks are more likely to happen when preceded by a long period of habituation, during which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. This was apparent in cases involving habituated North American wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Vargas Island Provincial Park and Ice Bay, as well as 19th century cases involving escaped captive wolves in Sweden and Estonia.",the wolves decided that you were not suitable as prey,0.600101709,1501,1554,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10553
10809,,Why is it prohibited to sleep in a tent?,to preserve nature and events need approval from authorities,"The tent just makes your intent obvious: You planned to sleep there from the beginning. And this is what the authorities want to prevent: Camping in the wild. On the other hand many legislations allow for emergency and high altitude bivouacs, which are inevitable. So the gray area developed where people sleep without a tent in order to escape punishment, as they are just bivouacking. In popular climbing areas in Switzerland they also fine you for bivouacking, as an emergency is clearly not the case (usually people carry stoves and more food/drink than you would ""expedition style""). So usually the distinction is planned/unplanned sleeping out in the wild, and often this has been adopted to sleeping with/without a tent, even though the two are certainly not equivalent. Another reason why bivouac is favored over tent: Bivouacking is associated with trekking lightweight, in which case you do not take stuff to throw away (that would be useless weight). So the potential for littering is generally smaller in bivouacking. EDIT Due to the interest this question has spawned and some comments, I informed myself about the laws here in Switzerland regarding this issue. Somewhat surprisingly on a national level Switzerland knows a ""Jedermannsrecht"": Article 699 of the ZGB (civil law) states that access to forest and meadow within the locally common extent is allowed to everyone. Fishing and hunting is excluded from this and regulated on the level of ""Kantone"". This is even more explicit in article 14 of WaG (laws concerning forest): ""Kantone"" have to make sure that the public can access forests. Again restricted locally to preserve nature and events need approval from authorities. Of course this is restricted by further laws about conservation areas, but it should be common place that in any kind of conservation area (there are lots of different kinds around here...), you have to inform yourself whether its allowed or not and in doubt, you don't. So one might think ""Why all this fuss about whether you can camp or not in the wild, this says you can..."". The problem lies in the details, which in this case is the access up to ""locally common extent"". As Switzerland is based on federality, meaning very strong independence of the ""Kantone"" and of municipalities, they can basically all choose what they consider ""common extent"". So basically in Switzerland you either ask in every municipality whether you are allowed to or not or you adhere to commonplace rules and the so called eleventh law: Don't get caught. Still I was not aware about the extent of legal backing for free access to woods around here: Basically you cannot fence any forest area even if you own it privately, as access to the public is granted (and walking through it is the basic kind of access, so you can't exclude it as ""locally uncommon"").

The Zip-in feature is nice when you are in a casual setting, but, from a performance stance, you are leaving a huge strip of your torso uninsulated (or under-insulated) if you use the zip-in feature. My old jacket caused 2-3 inches (6-8 cm) of a gap where the insulation of the fleece stopped, and the zippers of the two layers went together. 2-3 inches might not sound like a lot, but, given that this was a strip running the whole length of the center of my torso, I never used the two pieces as one combination jacket when I was doing anything 'for real' outside. It was also a problem of people mixing the brands. Even though almost all zippers in the USA come from YKK, exact lengths and sizes could vary enough to make mixing brands not 100% easy. I vastly prefer to have a separate fleece under my wind / water shell, so I don't mind that this trend seems to have died out. If you want one lined jacket for everyday use, go for it.

Population densities of large herbivores (overall - we often go to see them where they gather in large numbers, but they don't spend long in one place then, or they'll run out of food) are much lower in the wild than in even free range farming, so there just isn't that much to smell.

First, technical trail shoes are not ""city shoes"" If we're going to have an intelligent conversation we need to clear this up from the outset. You describe all types of lightweight footwear as ""city shoes"". This is an unhelpful caricature. While street shoes are obviously inappropriate for tough walking, technical trail and approach shoes are designed specifically to provide the grip and robustness required for this type of terrain. Second - lightweight walkers are not simply unprepared fashion victims We have to put this in proper context. You imply that anyone using lightweight footwear on difficult ground is simply unprepared or following a mindless trend. In fact, you'll find that the more experienced the walker, the more likely that they will be choosing to use lightweight footwear. I've been walking the hills for half a century. I've used every kind of footwear, and in almost all conditions I now have a strong preference for trail shoes. And I'm far from alone. Pretty much every experienced through-hiker is now using lightweight footwear, even on quite technical off-trail work like the Sierra High Route.

Either the entire community of long-distance walkers is experiencing some kind of collective delusion, or they know something that you are missing... Third - the traditional case for heavy walking boots doesn't stand up to scrutiny The specific claims you make for heavy footwear are that it protects the ankles and keeps the feet dry. But where is your evidence that heavy boots protect the ankles? I can't find any actual research that's remotely convincing. To provide meaningful ankle support, a boot has to be so rigid that it's virtually impossible to walk in the thing. In reality, a walking boot, as against a technical ice boot, provides insignificant ankle support when laced for comfort. On the other hand the high stack height, stiff sole and poor ground feel disrupt natural walking mechanics and leave you clumsy and unstable. I experienced a number of serious ankle injuries in conventional boots. Since I switched to lightweight trail shoes I've never had a problem, and I do a lot of rough off-trail walking. As for the idea that big boots keep the feet dry, I don't know many real walkers who'd agree. Your feet sweat, and heavy boots don't breathe. But the membranes in so-called breathable waterproof boots quickly break down and leak. And with any practical summer gaiter, water is going to penetrate through the gap at the ankle. Once they are wet, the type of boot you are advocating becomes even heavier and takes an age to dry. The great majority of long-distance walkers simply accept that their feet will get wet at times. They chose shoes that drain well and dry quickly, and wear merino socks that are warm when wet. On balance, this is much the most successful approach. Most long-distance walkers agree that the benefits of lightweight footwear greatly outweigh the disadvantages The real disadvantage of lightweight trail shoes is economic - you're going to be replacing them after every 500 miles or so of heavy use. On every other dimension, they are a much better choice than the old leather monsters that you are advocating. Trail shoes are far more energy efficient : research shows that a pound on the feet is equivalent to at least 5 lbs on the back. And on steep rough ground, that's probably an underestimate (the research was done on treadmills). Lightweight shoes are far less tiring to walk in, and you'll be significantly less prone to lower-body strain injuries. Trail shoes are far kinder on the feet : I've walked thousands of miles in trail shoes and never had a hot spot, never mind a blister. When I walked in big boots I had endless problems with blisters and bruising. Search Google Images for ""hiking blisters"" and you'll see graphic evidence of the misery big boots can cause: Trail shoes are far more nimble : you'll be significantly more balanced and less liable to fall. Falls in remote country can be serious, so this is a big deal. Trail shoes are far better for stream crossings . Stream crossings with big boots are a major faff. With trails shoes you just walk straight across. Your feet are grippy and protected during the crossing, and the shoes soon drain on the trail. As I say, the more experienced the walker, the more likely that they will chose lightweight shoes. And this will be a considered choice based on many thousands of miles of practical experience. You're welcome to choose the footwear you prefer - that's the freedom of the hills. But please keep an open mind and don't denigrate those who make other choices.",freedom of the hills,0.056767911,4826,4846,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11601

20731,,Why do people lock their tents at Everest Base Camp?,not a perfect solution,"Tent locks (or security awareness, or organisational policies, or anti-virus, or any security control) are not a perfect solution, so why use them? Flip the question around: what would happen if you did not use a lock (or awareness, or policies, or AV)? Any security control (that includes tent locks) aims to reduce risk . The hope of a control is simply to reduce the inherent risk at a cost that does not exceed the difference between the inherent risk and the residual risk (the risk after the control is applied). The control makes sense if either: the residual risk is at a level that we can accept and that the cost of the control does not exceed the delta between the inherent and residual risks, or the delta between the inherent and residual risks has greater value than the cost of the control Controls do not, and never will, eliminate risks. In the Everest scenario, the impact of supply theft is death or mission failure (we do not ascend). The cost of a lock is almost nothing in both cash and weight. More secure means of preventing theft will be heavier, and weight in a climbing scenario has a cost that at some point cannot be borne (pun intended). So, the options are: use a lock do not use a lock Given the impact of theft, what justification would you have for not using a lock, even if it was not a perfect control? I would also note that a lock is a "" preventative "" control. Inventorying, as you suggest, is a "" detective "" control.

24175,,Why is there such a singular place for bird watching?,to get them out of the way,"This is rather speculative, but draws on a few birding/wildlife books I've read and it's too much for a comment. It also has a little UK bias, but I've visited 4 continents on wildlife trips, and much of this seems universal. First, to get them out of the way: invertebrates may be interesting but in the general population there's a bit of a ""yuck factor"". Only butterflies (and maybe bees) really have much general appeal. I do know a couple of people who are as keen on their lepidoptera as birders are on their aves. Mammals are broadly interesting. They're what people with only a passing interest in wildlife go on safari, or to the zoo, to see (along with the largest reptiles). But for many people, especially city dwellers, sightings of wild mammals are rare. The creatures themselves are, and they're often nocturnal. I'm in a village and cycle at dawn and dusk, so see more than most, but still only see (introduced) grey squirrels and rabbits regularly, with deer and foxes occasionally, and badgers/weasels almost never. Rats have the yuck factor again for many people, and are to be avoided, while most people will only see smaller rodents if they've got a cat to bring them in. So to see interesting mammals takes effort. Much of this applies to reptiles/amphibians too. Birds on the other hand are visible, audible, and common. Having a few different attractive species visible from your own home is normal. Some (e.g. European Robins in the UK) approach close enough that you can really appreciate them, while others draw attention to themselves at a distance by singing - and birdsong is generally pleasant.

4341,,Why do many climbers appear to not trust their belay loops?,don't have the context to fully understand what they've been taught,"I've seen this kind of behavior. I think there's a tendency for people to want to continue to do things the way they're used to doing them, and the way they were originally trained. It can be a little frustrating when someone comes along and tells you that the new ""right way"" to do something is different that what you've done before. Also, if you're an experienced climber, you were probably trained several years ago. When new recommendations enter the climbing community, they're introduced in books and training classes that are mostly taken by beginners. So you have a situation where the people with the most up-to-date training don't have the context to fully understand what they've been taught, or necessarily apply it safely. This makes experienced climbers unlikely to take their advice. I've felt this myself - I used to rig a backup autoblock off my leg loop, until a friend convinced me to extend my rappel, and put the autoblock on my belay loop. It was honestly hard for me to hear, because my friend was actually pretty inexperienced, and I'd been climbing for 3 years at that point. But I eventually came around. FWIW, I hope we can all at least agree that harness manufactures recommend that climbers use the belay loop to belay, and both tie in points when they're tying in or putting a sling or anchor chain on their harness.

Advantages of a tent: Keeps more rain/snow out (particularly if you have little skill in tent/tarp setup) Keeps out insects. For me, this is the big one - in spring time when the mosquitoes are fierce, being confined to your sleeping bag with a net over your face is not nearly as pleasant as lounging in your enclosed tents. Warmer (this one is somewhat debatable, but on a a windy cold day, perhaps less. I know that square tarps let you pitch them to the wind... but winds shift) Usually easier to setup, especially for novices Privacy. Tents are usually very enclosed, so in a busy area, you can change without needing to bury yourself in your sleeping bag. Advantages of a tarp: closer to nature, as you said lighter (I can't stress this one enough!) I think though, you're forgetting that for lots of people, it's the hiking that's the pleasure, not necessarily the tenting. So the ""being close to nature"" happens all day and into the evening by a fire. Not necessarily while sleeping. I agree that it is nice to be in nature (especially when you can just cowboy camp). I also like a tarp with bug netting around the fringes, as it covers off the bugs issue.

10304,,Why do you not aim for the head while archery hunting?,deer brain is very small compared to the skull and presents a very small target,"Compare a human skull to that of a deer. The human skull is dominated by the brain, so a shot to the head is likely to penetrate the cranium and brain. On the other hand, a deer brain is very small compared to the skull and presents a very small target. Furthermore there are bony stuctures which might deflect away a bullet or arrow. See this picture of a fallow deer skull. Generally, large muscles need large anchor points, so an animal with strong neck muscles or strong jaw muscles will often have bony lumps and flanges on its skull (e.g. the sagital crest on a gorilla skull). A sagittal crest is a ridge of bone running lengthwise along the midline of the top of the skull (at the sagittal suture) of many mammalian and reptilian skulls, among others. In contrast, a deflected shot off a rib is still likely to go on and penetrate heart or lungs.

10759,,Why are eye friction hitches not commonly used in rock climbing?,I have no idea about splicing,"The main reasons is simplicity and habituation: A prusik made from a loop is easily taught and controlled. This is a point that many experienced climber forget about often: When people start they may struggle on the basic knots. So for the first thing to learn a simplicity is more important than functionality. And the prusik is a long established and reliable knot. Safety is good too: Just check the knot before use and add a turn if more friction required. Why do many people stick with it? The simplicity is reason again, but the other is simply habituation: It is much easier to simply stick with what you learned, it feels ""comfortable"". Another important aspect is interoperability: You (almost always) climb with a partner and should control each other, so all the knots must be known to both climbers. So you have to employ the smallest common denominator of knots, which is usually the more basic knots. Other uses are in mountaineering when on glaciers you use a prusik on the cord and hold the sling with your hand. This can then immediately be used for a preliminary anchor. For climbing I do not see any other uses. Why not the arbory knots you showed above? I think this is only for historical reasons: Different knots evolved in these two areas that had probably not significant enough overlap to merge. I can do a prusik without a pretied loop (you just need to secure the free end with e.g. a double fishermans). I learned this for a variation of a pulley in crevasse rescue, but it is simply more complicated: You have to do knots on both ends of the cord while in a loop you can just clip into. Here your point of cords with eyes in them comes into play: I simply never saw such a thing in climbing and as you stated I have no idea about splicing. So I guess definitely a culture thing (a friend of mine is arborist and avid climber, never saw one on him either). Still many people I climb with do use other friction knots. Some do not carry a pre-tied loop for prusiks with the argument that it can only be used for this single purpose and is thus ineffective. They use slings instead. I often use a longer pretied loop to do a knot we call ""Englaender-Prusik"" (literally: Englishman's Prusik, heard of it as French Prusik too :P, correctly: autoblock, thanks Mr.Wizard) for which you simply wind the cord some times around the rope and attach both ends to a locking biner: Easier and you cannot drop the cord as one end can always stay in the biner.",I have no idea about splicing,0.032490104,1738,1767,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10759
11829,,Why does a leader have to be tapered in fly fishing?,the control you get over your fly,"I will try to answer this, however i don't know the correct english terminology. The main reason for a tapered leader is the control you get over your fly. With a thick line, you flick (or roll, here comes the terminology issue) the tip of your rod, and you can see the ""wave"" travel forward through your line, until it ""whips"" at the end. If you try this with a very fine line, you won't see the wave travel at all, you will likely just pull your line sideways. Try create a whipping sound with a shoelace, then try to create a whipping sound with thin yarn. The energy can't travel through almost weightless material. Now back to the leaders. You want a (relatively) heavy line as far as possible towards the fly, to have maximum control. A quick circular flick in the tip of your rod will let your fly ""jump"" 10cm left or right if you are skilled enough, which can be the final necessary step to get a fish to bite. However, you also want to have a very fine, almost invisible line near your hook, to not scare fish away. If you attach a short, fine line directly to your main line, and whip your rod, the fly on the thin leader might jump uncontrollably. If you attack a long fine leader to your main line and whip, the thin line will just not transfer the energy, and your fly will do nothing (maybe be pulled through the water a little bit). You also don't want to have 5 lines of different thickness knotted together. The solution: a tapered leader, which will transfer the energy to your fly smoothly, with no big steps between two lines of different thickness. The energy can travel undisturbed and the line close to the hook is thin and invisible. If you don't want or have to control the fly in a distance, you probably could just use a longer thin leader directly attached to your main line, for example when you use large streamers for northern pike (don't forget your steel leader ;)). But by controlling the smaller dry fly you make it jump small distances, just like a fly would after falling in the water.

14475,,Why would archery season be either before or after rifle season?,local populations that are too high,"Your question was about deer hunting in Pennsylvania and Oregon where the majority of the deer are whitetail deer and mule deer, respectively. My answer applies to both, generally. There are many other species of deer, and I am not referring to them here. Also, the answer to your question is very complicated. I'll try to keep it short. Before a game department can design any deer hunt, whether rifle, archery, or any other, they must understand the needs of deer versus the needs of other animals, including humans. Therefore, they employ biologists to help guide the process. These biologists study deer herds extensively (and most other wildlife), and provide a ton of information. Here is an example of Idaho's summary of its deer herd in 2016. (Idaho has lots of whitetail and mule deer hunting opportunities.) It is also helpful to hunters to understand, at least basically, the needs of deer and their resulting behaviors. Following is a short summary of deer behavior and how it changes throughout the fall months: Deer change their behavior throughout the year due to weather, food sources, breeding, and hunting, among many other reasons. These factors change quickly in autumn, when most hunting seasons take place, and easily change deer behavior. I like to break autumn into four main ""seasons"" of deer behavior: 1. Late-Summer; 2. Transition; 3. Rut; and 4. Winter. In Late-Summer, which is mostly the month of September, deer are still acting as they typically would during summer: scattered and mostly relaxed. This is because food is plentiful, the weather is excellent, and even though there are a few hunters out and about in early hunting seasons, most humans in the woods are just camping and hiking and not pursuing the deer. During Transition, late-September through late-October, the weather is growing cold, food sources are changing (some are dying and others are maturing), and more hunters (and fewer hikers/campers) are in the woods. The deer congregate more near food sources, but can quickly become nocturnal to avoid hunters who are more active and spread out away from roads and main trails. From late-October through mid-November, the Rut is on (varies a little by region). Bucks seek out does, often in small herds (whitetail and mule deer herd behavior is different), and are often traveling during daylight hours. They are less wary and easier to find. By late-November, Winter is usually setting in. There is a second rut in December for the minority of does that were not bred in November, and the bucks who sniff them out. For the majority of deer, however, the rut is over and they continue in earnest to build fat for winter. Most bucks did not eat much during the rut and have already burned through some of their winter fat. Both bucks and does travel more during the day, especially during good weather, in search of whatever food is left so they can store as much winter fat as possible. Game departments have many different issues (varies tremendously by location) to think about when they are planning when and how long to hold deer hunts, in addition to which type of weapon to allow. In one state, a hunter will usually find dozens, if not hundreds, of different hunts to choose from - categorized by date and geography. One hunt area might offer a hunter a tiny sliver of a chance in some type of lottery system just to get the opportunity to hunt, while another area might offer the hunter the chance to shoot multiple deer in one day (the hunter often must choose one hunt or the other in any given year - cannot hunt both). These hunts are designed to help game departments reach their objectives, which usually are directly related to population but can also be related to moving deer out of certain locations, like farmers' fields. (Idaho - which I'm most familiar with - holds a lot of these types of hunts during August when many early crops are maturing. Many states also hold depredation hunts, rifle or archery, which target local populations that are too high and are either causing property damage or the deer will starve if numbers aren't cut drastically and immediately.) Now, with this information in mind, we can attempt an answer to the question of holding an archery season before or after a rifle season. The short answer varies tremendously by area. If it's been a good year for deer and there are way more deer than the land can support through the winter, then they could schedule the rifle hunt (where total harvest is usually much higher) to coincide with those times when deer are easier to find, ie. more congregated and traveling/feeding during the day. That would be during the later ""seasons"" Rut and Winter, and sometimes at the earliest ""season"" of Late-Summer. However, if deer populations are only a little high, the rifle hunt would normally be held during Transition, when fewer campers/hikers are in the woods and deer are more congregated but often quickly go nocturnal. If deer populations are about right or a little low, the rifle hunt will likely be during Transition and will be short, sometimes only a day or two - or may be cancelled altogether. (Deer reproduce quickly, so this only happens when some other factor is very abnormal, such as drought, disease, predator overpopulation, etc.) Bowhunting, on the other hand, usually accounts for a much smaller harvest and, therefore, archery hunts can be scheduled to cover much longer periods of time, even during ""seasons"" when the deer are much easier to find (Late-Summer, Rut, Winter). For example, in Oregon's 2014 deer hunt, about 166,000 deer were harvested in rifle hunts (varying lengths in October [Transition], depending on the area), and about 51,000 deer were harvested in archery hunts in the entire month of September (Late-Summer), and a few weeks in November (Rut) and December (Winter). Link for Oregon's 2014 deer harvest summary. Link for a summary of Oregon's deer hunts. Pennsylvania also has a variety of hunts to choose from. The rifle hunts are very short and are held later: a few short hunts in mid-October (Transition), but most seem to be a few days around the first of December (Winter) and a longer one that starts at the end of December and goes into January (Winter). Archery, on the other hand, starts as early as mid-September and extends into early-November, then starts up again in late-December and goes into January. Despite these much longer hunts, covering all ""seasons"", archery only accounted for about 93,000 deer in 2014, while rifle hunters harvested about double, at around 190,000 deer. See these links for more information on the 2014 deer harvest and deer hunting , in general, in Pennsylvania. In short, archery and rifle hunts are tools for game departments to manage deer populations while also allowing hunters to TRY to meet some of their own needs. The timing of archery versus rifle hunts depends on many variables, is very complicated, and varies by state.",local populations that are too high,0.271179944,3988,4023,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14475

16568,,Why should lights be turned off on beaches where turtles breed?,"a nesting turtle likes quiet, dark beaches","The Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC) gives two reasons for keeping beaches dark at night when sea turtles are laying or hatching. The first reason the STC gives is that a nesting turtle likes quiet, dark beaches. If she cannot find such a spot after several attempts, she will choose a less than ideal spot to lay her eggs, and perhaps even lay them in the ocean. This reduces the probability of survival for the hatchlings. Having been liberally splattered with sand by a turtle laying in broad daylight (Aldabra Atoll, the Seychelles) as one of a ring of observing tourists (quiet and motionless tourists), I personally put greater emphasis on the second reason given by the STC. Lighting near the shore also can cause hatchlings to become disoriented and wander inland, where they often die of dehydration or predation. Hatchlings, scientists believe, have an innate instinct that leads them in the brightest direction, which is normally moonlight reflecting off of the ocean. Excess lighting from the nearshore buildings and streets draw hatchlings toward land, where they may be eaten, run over, or drown in swimming pools. I'd welcome more expert opinion on the sensitivity of nesting females to light. The adult turtles I have encountered seem phlegmatic, but maybe inside they are nervous.

17435,,Why is (almost) no one climbing hard routes on Half Dome?,the peculiar structure of HD makes it more subject to dangerous rockfalls,"Reading the comments and discussing with other users helped me get a much better idea of the possible causes why we hear of so many hard (sometimes free) ascents on El Capitan and almost none on Half Dome. 1. The approach Fig. 1 - The two possible approaches to HD and the Regular NW Face route [From summitpost.org ] According to mountainproject.com , there are two possible approaches to Half Dome (HD): 1) Hike up from Happy Isles up the Mist Trail through Little Yosemite Valley (approx. 8 miles to the shoulder of Half Dome). 2) Head over from Happy Isles past Mirror Lake and hike up the ""Death Slabs"". Option 1 is smooth hiking and clearly the way to go for the south facing routes. Option 2 is significantly faster (for the NW face), in both directions, but requires skilled route finding, very steep hiking, and use of fixed lines. Supertopo.com gives an approach time of 3 hours to get to the base of the Regular Northwest Face route (which is on the left side of the NW face, see Fig.1), and even if it is not specified if it is via the trail or via the Death Slabs we can guess is via the Slabs, since it is the fastest path to the NW face. Some quotes from other websites about the approach: Get your gear and partner in order. Do an excruciating approach up thousands of feet , passing hundreds of knackered tourists from all over the world. Although a few will recognize you as a climber, most will look at you like you're a bit off in the head for shlepping an enormous, orange plastic backpack up the several million steps. And in many ways they're right, for you're about to pull off one of the most spectacular climbs on the face of our fair planet.[ mountainproject.com ] - HD is more of an alpine wall, with a grueling 2.5 hr-half day approach and loose/impossible hauling that forces people to go fast and light.[ yosemitebigwall.com , about the route The Reg] [Fig. 2 - The Death Slabs - From supertopo.com ] So the approach to HD is not easy: either an 8 miles trail up to the shoulder and then down, or 3 hours up the Death Slabs, a path which includes parts on fixed ropes and some tricky climbing passages (more about the Slabs on summitpost.org ). For comparison, the approach to The Nose on El Cap takes just 10 minutes . Working on a hard project requires spending days, weeks, sometimes months on the route. If the route is on El Cap, this is not a problem since it is possible to go by car and simply walk for 10 minutes to the base of the route. This is not the case with HD. 2. Route level Today, aid climbing is not as popular as in the past, and strong climber try to make new free ascents or to free old aid climbing routes. So, when talking about the level, I will concentrate on free ascents. Yosemitebigwall.com provides a list of the most famous routes in Yosemite by length and level. Amongst the routes listed as ""beginner"" level, only one, the Regular NW Face, is on HD, while El Cap has 5. At ""intermediate"", we find 25 El Cap routes, but only 3 HD routes. It looks therefore that the average level of the routes on HD is higher than that on El Cap. Take for example the famous route Zodiac , on El Capitan: 5.7 A3, 15 pitches. The Huber brothers, who first freed it in 2015 , evaluated the difficulty of the free ascent 5.13+. Since then (at the moment I'm writing is October 2017), the route has seen only other two free ascents as far as I know, by Tommy Caldwell in 2015 and by the team composed by Barbara Zangerl and Jacopo Larcher in 2016. The closest routes in terms of difficulty and length that we can find on HD are: South Face, Half Dome South Face VI 5.8 A3 17 pitches Tis sa ack, Half Dome Northwest Face VI 5.9 A2+ or C3 21 pitches Direct Northwest Face, Half Dome Northwest Face VI 5.10 A2+ 24 pitches all of which are longer than Zodiac and as hard, if not harder. Of these three routes, only the Direct NW Face has been free climbed , the first time in 1992 by Todd Skinner and the second time by Tommy Caldwell in 2007. The difficulty of the free ascent is reported to be around 5.13c/d. More about big wall free climbing in Yosemite: https://web.stanford.edu/~clint/yos/longhf.htm#half . 3. Danger In 2015, a key section of the famous Regular NW Face route on HD fell off . Quoting climbingyosemite.com : Water staining on this slab suggests that large portions of the rock sheet that fell were completely separated from the adjacent (and now exposed) rock for decades prior to failure. [Fig 3 - The flake structure of the rock of HD - From elcapreport ] By looking at pictures of the rock on HD, we can see that there are many similar ""flake"" structures on the NW face, where most of the climbing routes are (Fig. 3). Actually, the gradual falling of sheets of rock is how HD NW face was formed in the first place; quoting nps.gov : A number of geologic processes set the stage for rockfalls, including glaciation, weathering, and bedrock fractures. Tectonic stresses and erosion cause granite rock to fracture. Rockfalls later occur along these fractures. Fractures that develop parallel to the surface are called sheeting joints . Sheeting joints create large slabs of rock that ultimately fall away in a process known as exfoliation. In Yosemite Valley, Royal Arches and the face of Half Dome are examples of landforms that have resulted from this process . Over long periods, water flowing through fractures decomposes the bedrock in a process called weathering. Weathering loosens bonds that hold rocks in place. These recent rockfalls have left many people wondering wether that section of HD is has not become too dangerous to climb . It may be, therefore, that the peculiar structure of HD makes it more subject to dangerous rockfalls. From the above map ( nps.gov ) we can see that even if there have been many rockfalls on El Cap, most of the biggest ones are in winter and fall, when the walls are less frequented. The NW face of HD, on the other side, had many big rockfalls in spring and summer, when the frequentation is higher (especially in spring and early summer).",the peculiar structure of HD makes it more subject to dangerous rockfalls,0.135537282,5635,5708,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17435

Even in winter they're in the full sun much of the day. It would drop below freezing at night, but during the day temperatures would regularly get above 50 ¬∞F (10¬∞ C). In the summer the heat can be overwhelming. Aside from the difficulty of performing extremely gymnastic climbing in high temps, sweaty hands make tenuous holds impossible. Gymnastic chalk can only do so much to counteract that. It also turns out that the spring and fall shoulder seasons are problematic because ice forms on the wall every night and peels off during the day.

21801,,Why use a 20 MOA rail on top of a rifle?,so that you need less scope adjustment,"For long range shooting, you have to aim above the target in order to hit it. For example, a 308 will have dropped 340 inches at 1,000 yards. Source Instead of aiming above, it is possible to dial a scope in so that you can hold the crosshairs directly on the target. However, scopes have a limited amount of movement. A 20 MOA (or 30 or 40) rail will point the rifle up 20 MOA so that you need less scope adjustment. At 1,000 yards with a 308, you would need to adjust up 34 MOA, while with a 20 MOA scope base, you would just need 14 MOA of upward adjustment. This is more common on long-range rifles because with most rifles you don't need to be aiming 20 inches up at 100 yards, and so you would have to aim low at shorter distances. The other use case for this is long range shooting with 22lr, the drop is between 18-30 MOA at 200 yards due to the low velocity of the cartridge, especially with subsonic rounds.",so that you need less scope adjustment,0.449634999,378,416,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21801

13631,,Why are tourniquets not recommended as a first aid for a snakebite?,It's likely too late anyway,"There are several issues with tourniquets for snake bite: It's likely too late anyway The venom will spread rapidly though your system (as Weda says, the lymphatic system is the main carrier, not blood). The chances of you getting a tourniquet on before this has happened is minuscule. It keeps all the venom in one place Even if you do somehow manage to contain the venom, it's all in one place now! This means that a single area gets an incredibly high dose of venom. Bear in mind many snakes deliver a bite strong enough to kill several adult humans, now concentrate all that venom into a single limb. The damage caused is massive. The tissue dies and infection gets in. The tourniquet is likely going to damage the limb as much as the bite Stopping the blood is going to (obviously) starve the limb of blood. This is going to cause necrosis (dying off of tissue) which causes infection. Tourniquets are not to be used lightly. They should only ever be used as a last resort to prevent someone bleeding out. A limb that has had a tourniquet applied for a long period of time is a dead limb and will likely need to be amputated. Eventually the tourniquet needs to be removed So now you have large amounts of damaged tissue, etc in this single limb; eventually someone has to remove this tourniquet or else you're going to lose that limb anyway. Doing so releases all the venom and damaged tissue, necrosis, infection, etc. into your blood stream. Rather than containing the venom, you've concentrated it and released it anyway along with lots of other nasties... The best thing to do if you get bitten, is to get antivenom FAST! Your priority should be this; don't waste your time or effort trying to suck the venom out or contain it.

I tell you that loading a canoe with the amount of weight they declare is something that can be done only on a calm day. I've run into one company that give the required weight to raise the water line inch by inch. (Clipper, I think...) Rules of thumb: A foot of extra canoe is added in the middle. The ends are the same. So the capacity goes up fast with increasing length. Making it narrower doesn't decrease the capacity nearly as fast, but it decreases stability in a hurry. I took a 32"" beam canoe, took out the thwarts, and cranked it down to 30 inches. Made it noticeably faster, and a lot tippier. Now this would also have altered the cross section of the boat, so it's not just because it's narrower. Consider 15 foot canoe as a solo boat for a big person; as a tandem canoe for kids at the cottage, possibly a weekend tripping boat for average size people. I liked the Discover series for tripping in Northern Saskatchewan. The 163 was good for the kids. 169 was good for most staff, and we had a big 172 for our ox -- staff member who was 6' 3"" and 220 lbs. Typically a canoe carried 2 people, 2 70 liter sealine personal packs, 2 sealine group gear packs. Personal packs were typically about 30-40 pounds. Food packs could be 80-100 at the start of a trip. So 280 pounds plus people. If people was a pair of 120 pound grand 9's, you got 520. More often it would be a 150 pound senior and a 120 pound shrimp. Play with the numbers. It's hard to get above 600. We were out for 2-3 weeks at a time. Figure 2 pounds dry weight food per man day, to increase it by another 2 weeks would be 14 days * 2 people/canoe * 2 pounds/day = another 56 pounds per canoe.

No doubt wetting swells the threads of the canvas, which then offer a closer surface to the action of the wind ; but if the sails are new they do not so much require it, and the jumping about of the men will do more harm than good. Another disadvantage may arise from their not being wetted evenly, which, in the hurry and excitement of the moment, the chances are they will not be ; The Yacht Sailor. A Treatise on Practical Yachtsmanship, Cruising and Racing The general practice among English yachtsmen when the America arrived there in 1851, was to cut and sew the sails so they would form themselves into a bag to hold the wind, although the advantage of flatness of surface for plying to windward was well understood, and the practice of wetting, or as they termed it, ‚Äúskeeting‚Äù the canvas, was well understood and often employed on board racing boats and ships to flatten their canvas. How Sails are Made and Handled: With a Chapter on Racing Kinks It appears from theory that the wetting the sails of a ship should increase the advantageous action of the wind upon them, not only by closing up the interstices between the threads of which they are com posed, but likewise making the sails stand flatter.

A tube style belay device needs a high, ideally 180¬∞ angle between the loaded strand of rope towards the climber and the breaking strand in the belayers hand. That's why the base position is holding your arm down besides your legs when belaying. If there is no redirection of the rope on an anchor/protection between the belayer and the climber, the two strands will end up parallel pointing down, and the breaking force of the tuber will be approximately zero. Yes, in theory you could hold the breaking strand upwards, but that's against what you normally do (and reflexes matter) - so don't do that. The same strategy as with multi-pitch climbing as explained above is banned in the article: The leader's rope does not go through the belay point, as it would be torn out in case of a fall. Clipping the rope into a biner/quickdraw on the anchor is definitely a bad idea due to the doubling of the forces. However you can totally put the belay directly on the anchor to prevent that. And if you have a solid ice screw or dead man anchor in the snow, that will hold just as much as a bolt (or more) anyway. However again, a tuber wouldn't be suitable due to breaking direction. Different argument: Unless you need to abseil (long distances), you don't need a tube belay device when mountaineering. Most of the time you wont need to belay, and if you do you can just use a Munter/rock horn/body to belay. Even if you need to abseil, you can do that with just carabiners too. In mountaineering, weight counts a lot.",breaking direction,0.044620387,1554,1572,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19404
19881,,"Why do almost all backpacking packs have top compartment (""brain compartment"") zippers facing backwards?",almost everything falls out,"While I don't have a definitive answer, I do have a few anecdotal / personal experience reasons to prefer the zipper across the back. In order to keep terminology consistent, the ""back of the pack"" will refer to the side against the wearer and the ""front of the pack"" will refer to the opposite, non-strap side. I'll also be focusing on a typical top loading pack, with a main top-loading compartment and a floating top-compartment / brain. When the main compartment needs to be accessed, the top lid gets flopped out of the way towards the main backpack straps. If the zipper on the top lid was on the front, then contents of the brain compartment would rest directly against the zipper in this orientation. In particular, consider what happens if you flop the top compartment out of the way without it zipped up---almost everything falls out. With the zipper on the back, there is a lower likelihood of losing everything. With some practice, you can even just pinch the closure shut and flop the top compartment out of the way without losing anything or wasting time doing and undoing the zipper. If the main body of the pack isn't fully loaded, the top compartment tends to slump towards the front of the pack, as the attachment point to the back panel is generally higher up. If the zipper ran across the front, then all of the contents would be resting directly against the (perhaps not completely closed) zipper. In contrast, with the zipper running along the back, contents rest against the stitched seams and would need to bounce up and out of the opening left by a partially undone zipper. I have accidentally set off down the trail after a break with the top compartment half undone, only to find that all of the contents are still inside a mile down the trail. Had the zipper been on the front side, I would not have been so lucky. Zippers are somewhat fragile, especially when compared sewn seams---for example, see this clip of how easy it is to break into zippered luggage. Having equipment resting directly against a zipper can potentially do similar things, hence trying to place the zipper (even a fully closed one) in a position where gear is less likely to rest directly against it. This ties in with points 1 and 2. Zippers don't deal well with sand & dust. Typically, most people don't like to lay their back panel & straps in the dirt, so placing the zipper along the back of the top compartment reduces the chances of it getting thrown in the dirt. Zippers also need some weather protection---a standard zipper will let in a surprising amount of water in a rain storm. The easiest way to do this is with a small storm flap covering the zipper, necessitating that it runs along the front or back of the compartment. This is also why zippers tend to run along the compartment somewhere towards the bottom of the compartment. Some manufacturers (e.g., Arc'Teryx) have some packs where the zipper runs across the top of the compartment, but use a more expensive waterproof zipper. With the zipper across the back of the top compartment, you can access items without even break stride by simply slinging the backpack on one shoulder. If you do this with, e.g., your right arm through the left should strap, the zipper on the top compartment will be directly in front of you for easy access.",almost everything falls out,0.103135258,816,843,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19881

22274,,Why might a larger peregrine falcon chick take longer to molt than smaller siblings?,sexual dimorphism in size,"Between the comments, continued observation of the Falcon-Cams, a little wiki-reading, and information on the site of the sponsor of the cams, I think I can confidently give myself the answer. First, the chicks have different appearances, and particularly different development of adolescent plumage versus hatchling down, simply because they are different ages. Falcons may lay a clutch of several eggs per breeding season, but they are not all laid at the same time and do not hatch at the same time. The chick with the most down is probably a full week younger than the others. Looking at the same web-cams one week later, it is far less downy now, and maybe even less downy than the siblings were one week ago. Further, the Lansing (Michigan) Board of Water and Light (LBWL), host of the falcon's nestbox and sponsor of the web-cams, shows on its site the dates of laying and hatching of all prior clutches, confirming the normal week-long spans of laying and hatching. (EDIT: The Falcon Fact Sheets seem to have been removed from LBWL's community sites. I will keep looking and correct the link if able.) Next, the younger chick is probably female, while the older two are probably male. LBWL along with Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) did a check and banding of the chicks, as mentioned before, but has not yet announced the results. However, wikipedia's page on Falco peregrinus informs us that ""the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male."" From there the rest is conjecture, but is a safe conclusion nevertheless. On a personal note, as of this moment the two older chicks appear on the brink of jumping out any minute and taking flight.

8539,,Why did I get goosebumps after drinking water while walking in Hot and Humid weather?,the humidity was causing an even greater Perspiration rate than usual,"Okay, I think I have figured it out a bit after discussing with a few fellow mountaineers. There are 3 major factors to consider: Heat and Humidity Hydration Perspiration As I had mentioned, it was pretty hot and humid out there. It was almost midday and I was alone and had climbed up close to 4000 ft that morning and descended about 2000 ft with a little more than 3 ltr of water consumed. Whether I was doing okay with hydration or not is another question but I had not observed any of the symptoms of dehydration at all. I have observed that on a humid day, one may end up drinking some quantity of water and perspire more due to humidity and so loose more fluids than what he/she has consumed through the day. After a certain exhaustion, with that amount of heat and humidity, the thermal regulation system might get overwhelmed. That would result in increasing the core temperature. The exertion would inhibit the evaporation of sweat further compromising the body‚Äôs thermoregulation mechanism. Another question arises when I ask myself ""Was I consuming enough fluids to remain hydrated?"" The other factor that impedes the thermoregulation mechanism is Dehydration. It has its impact on sweat production. So even though I had drank enough water, the humidity was causing an even greater Perspiration rate than usual. Then there are two possible situations: both resulting in Blocked sweat pores. The excessive sweating blocks the sweat pores (Eccrine Sweat Glands), the perspiration accumulates on the skin, it naturally evaporates. As the sweat evaporates, it cools down the skin surface and the Thermoregulation mechanism goes haywire resulting in a Heat Stroke. You don't continue drinking water and continue to sweat, and finally get so dehydrated that no more sweat is produced. That is when you see rashes on the skin. In my case, those were early symptoms of a Heat Stroke.",the humidity was causing an even greater Perspiration rate than usual,0.08668144,1253,1322,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8539
15838,,Why are common grackles standing on our bird feeders with their heads pointed straight up?,perching,"Those grackles are engaged in a courting behavior, most frequently called ‚Äúbill tilt.‚Äù It's also been called ‚Äúhead up‚Äù or ‚Äúhead up threat.‚Äù While establishing pairs for mating, males vie for the attention of the females. Usually as the birds arrive, a group of males will chase the females. Gradually the males drop off until there are fewer males vying for the attention of each female. Once they settle in at the feeding and nesting areas, the males begin the process of establishing dominance, thus increasing their chance of attracting the specific female who'll become his mate. The males won't do the head tilt unless at least one other male and one female is present. The females may also do the head tilt, but once the pair is established, they both discontinue it. In each group, the male who can tilt his head farthest back and hold it the longest is considered dominant and the other males respect that. Although the grackles may engage in some physical sparring behavior to establish dominance, much of that is avoided by this behavior. From page 208 of Stokes Backyard Bird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Identifying and understanding the birds in your back yard. : Watch the common grackles at your bird feeder. Every once in a while they'll look up as if they were looking at the sky. (They are not really looking at the sky; when birds do that they tilt their head to one side.) This display, called ‚Äúbill tilt‚Äù, is part of their language. It is usually done between two males or two females when they are competing for dominance over a mate or at a feeding site. The display is held for several seconds, and then the birds resume feeding. Bill tilting is especially likely to occur when new birds arrive on the scene. From Pennsylvania State University Groups of grackles foraging in a common feeding area frequently display dominance and aggression behaviors toward each other. One of these behaviors is the ‚Äúbill-tilt.‚Äù Interacting birds tilt their heads upward and point their bills toward the sky. The more dominant the bird, the more upwardly tilted their heads! The ruffling of feathers is also a courting or nesting behavior. Males put on a display for females by fanning their wings and tail, ruffling feathers and tilting their bills. Females quiver their wings in response. Source World-renowned ornithologist, Arthur Cleveland Bent, compiled a large group of studies and visual reports of grackles and their behavior dating back to the late 1800s. The following is a quote from Witmer Stone in 1937, published by Mr. Bent: As early as March 5, I have seen evidence of mating and sometimes two males have been in pursuit of a single female, resting near her in the tree tops, where they adopted a curious posture with neck stretched up and bill held vertically. As early as March 13, many of the Grackles are flying in pairs, the male just behind the female and at a slightly lower level. They are noisy, too, about the nest trees and there is a constant chorus of harsh alarm calls, 'chuck, chuck, chuck,' like the sound produced by drawing the side of the tongue away from the teeth, interspersed with an occasional long drawn 'seeek,' these calls being uttered by birds on the wing as well as those that are perching. Then at intervals from a perching male comes the explosive rasping ""song"" 'chu-seeeek' accompanied by the characteristic lifting of the shoulders, spreading of the wings and tail, and swelling up of the entire plumage. The sounds are described and Illustrated in Peterson's Field Guide to Bird Sounds of North America Interestingly, the specific calls will be used between males and females or males and males while in a group. Much like the head tilt, the male uses it only in the presence of other males.

5425,,Why should the angle in a rope attached to two anchors be 60 degrees or less?,There is nothing magic,"The diagram shows three situations that are easy to understand without knowing a lot of math or physics. In the first example, the angle between the anchor strands is zero. Both anchors pull straight up on the biner, and each supports 50% of the load. In the second example, all three angles are 120 degrees. The situation is totally symmetrical, so all three forces are equal in strength. Each anchor strand has to be able to support 100% of the load. For example, if the climber is hanging from the rope (a static load), and weighs 100 pounds, then each anchor strand will also be subject to 100 pounds of stress. This is obviously not that great a situation, and each anchor is just as likely to fail as if you had simply hung the climber off of that anchor alone. However, the anchor is redundant, so this is still better than a single anchor. The third example shows a hypothetical situation where the angle at the top opens up to 180 degrees. This isn't actually physically possible. Each anchor strand is only applying a horizontal force to the biner. There is no upward force on the biner that could cancel the downward force from the climber's strand. No matter how tight you were to pull the two anchor strands, they would never flatten out to 180 degrees. As the angle gets closer and closer to 180 degrees, the strain approaches infinity, and you're guaranteed that something in the system will fail. Maybe the rope will snap, or maybe the biner will break, or maybe one of the anchors will pull out. There is nothing magic about 60 degrees. As the angle increases, the stress on each anchor increases. An angle of 50 degrees could be too much, if your anchors were poor and you needed to hold a big dynamic load. An angle of 90 degrees could be perfectly OK, if the anchors were good and they just needed to hold a small static load. There could be a situation where I just had no choice but to do an arrangement like the 120-degree example, because it just wasn't physically possible to set up with a smaller angle. (Maybe something's in the way, or there's not enough rope, or the smaller angle would require the biner to be so low that I couldn't safely reach it, or the smaller angle would send anchor strands over a sharp knife-edge of rock.) I would still prefer such a setup to a non-redundant anchor.",There is nothing magic,0.075757734,1513,1535,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5425

It is not a good idea to store your sleeping bag compressed as small as possible as this will damage the fill. This is very important with down, a little less with synthetic but overall it is crucial to the life of the sleeping bag. A couple things to remember are you want to ensure the bag is dry before storage and it will be stored in a dry area free of excess condensation. You also want to randomly toss it about in the larger storage bag as opposed to rolling it then storing. Rolling up your new sleeping bag will create creases in the same spot over and over and your bag will develop cold spots where the insulation separates as a result of these creases.

11353,,"Why is it tiring to ""keep down"" with a slower person on a walk or hike?",if you are carrying a pack,"In general every individual has a natural walking cadence (steps per minute) and they vary their actual speed by increasing or decreasing stride length. Even amongst a very fit group the most comfortable natural pace will vary and some people will be built for speed on the flat while some stroll up brutal hills others will happily carry their own bodyweight in kit at a steady pace over any terrain. However the degree to which you can vary pace is limited and there is a point where your strides are uncomfortably long or (as in this case) short to maintain an efficient gait. The main reason for this is that natural walking is effectively a whole series of fallings forward ie you aren't pulling yourself forward with your feet you are swinging your centre of mass forward and moving your feet to maintain balance. So your natural gait is a lot like a pendulum and like a pendulum it has a natural frequency. As this happens you are transferring energy around a bit like a slinky falling down some steps, although some energy is lost each step a natural walking pace will conserve quite a lot from one to the next. If you have to move too slowly the your gait becomes a sequence of individual steps rather than a smooth flow from one stance to another and rather than a recycling the energy of each step you end up using energy to hold yourself back and check your stride. This is exacerbated if you are carrying a pack as you end up accelerating and decelerating it with every step rather than keeping your centre of mass moving at a fairly constant velocity. In practice if you are walking with someone who is struggling it is best for everybody for you to take some of their gear and/or for you to continue at your own pace for a while and then stop and wait for them. Also if someone is having trouble have a group rest and find out if there is any underlying reason why they are struggling, if they are carrying too much weight, are dehydrated, hungry ete etc it is better for the group as a whole to solve that issue than let them struggle even if you have to push them to admit it.

20449,,Why are long-distance hiking trails in the USA so much more famous than in Europe?,we have a full network of trails and paths,"In the more densely populated areas of Central Europe these long distance trails just seamlessly blend in with regional or local trails, so while the whole, say, 2690 km of the EB Eisenach - Budapest may not be well-known, e.g. its westernmost 170 km is the Rennsteig , a very famous regional trail in Germany which is moreover very old: it used to be a commercial trade route and according (no chance to be lonely there short of a November storm in the clouds) to Wikipedia has been known under this name for about 700 years. Some of the regional and even long distance trails are famous as century-old historical trade or pilgrim routes and connections between cities. Which points to a very different origin of those famous trail compared, to more or less recent recreational/dedicated hiking trails such as the Alpe-Adria or the Kungsleden on the one hand and e.g. rescue trails like the Juan de Fuca and West Coast Trails (famous, North America, regional). And in consequence, they are woven into the local network of roads and paths: Personally, being at home in that dense Central European network of hiking trails, forest paths, roads and field tracks we have in the German hills, so far I have hardly ever considered ""doing"" such a regional or long distance hiking trail - although I've been on lots of them: as we have a full network of trails and paths the way I approach this over here is that I grab a map, think from where I want to hike to where and then decide to follow this trail from here to there, then turn on that one, then... and so on. In consequence, names of these trails are very much a side note to me. In contrast, Canadian Juan de Fuca Trail had just a few access paths that one could take to get to the close by road (its original purpose was helping shipwreck survivors to get out of the forest), and Matario Trail (of local fame, I was in a group of a few people, but we did not meet anyone else) basically stretches between two access points with the only diversion being canoe portages. The bottom line is that for these trails, there decision is pretty much to hike them completely or not at all. So if you go hiking there, you do the Mantario Trail, whereas you may do the Rennsteig, or do part of the Rennsteig and then turn somewhere as you like. Remember, the original purpose of the Rennsteig was to give access to various towns. And this was achieved by the Rennsteig being a through-hiking trail along the crest of the Thuringian forest plus various side trails leading down the valleys to the towns (thus achieving the connection climbing up and down only once pretty much between any two of those towns). And nowadays regional tourism offices make that there are so many named trails that really it is easier to remember just where to go without the name. Just looked it up: on Sunday I actually crossed Limes trail while on the Luther Trail (both listed as a European long distance trails). In that sense I'd say that regional marketing in Central Europe has lead to such a proliferation of trails that the importance of the individual trails is much diluted (with the exception of maybe a very few very famous ones). I think this is good, as I'm talking about a region with > 200 inhabitants/·∏±m¬≤ which even on that vast number of trails and paths is definitively not going to be lonely on the average Sunday. Another consequence is that the old trade trails and some of the long distance trails sometimes run along major highways (or at least their original route is now a major highway) and they even cross large cities due to the historical routes they follow. But I have to admit that crossing Berlin on foot along the E11 does look like a dreary piece of work to me even though they reasonably kept to parks.

11001,,Why aren't there any electric stoves that can be used for cooking where you can't build a fire?,very few bright ideas survive the long journey from notebook to laboratory to factory,"Comparing hydrocarbons with batteries As Olin Lathrop wrote, the big problem is energy density: hydrocarbon fuels simply offer a huge amount of energy per unit mass, compared to any current battery technology. To put some numbers on this, we can look at Wikipedia's page on energy density . Let's compare ethanol (probably the least energy-dense of the commonly used camping stove fuels) with non-rechargeable lithium batteries (the most energy-dense of current battery technologies). Ethanol fuel provides 26.4 MJ/kg; lithium batteries provide 1.8 MJ/kg -- less than one-fourteenth as much per unit mass. So if you had 100 g of ethanol (about 127 ml) for cooking purposes and wanted to substitute it with electrical power, you'd need about 1.4 kg of disposable lithium batteries . If you want rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, you'll need about 2.8 kg of them (the energy density is about half that of disposables). As gerrit pointed out in the comments, you also need to think about power density: even if your battery contains enough energy to cook, it might not be able to output that energy fast enough for practical cooking. Battery technology is improving all the time, but there are no technologies currently in development which would give anything like the order-of-magnitude improvement needed to make them competitive with hydrocarbons for energy density. So it's not ideal, but is it feasible? It's clear that batteries are far less energy-dense than hydrocarbon fuels, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're a lost cause -- perhaps the extra weight would be small enough to be manageable, especially if you're hiking in a German forest where the only alternatives to flameless heating are breaking the law and eating cold food. I'll start by picking a battery pack, then look at how much cooking we could get out of it. This E-bike battery pack is currently retailing on Amazon for around 277 USD. Its vital statistics are: 24 V, 11 Ah, 262 Watt-hours or 943 kJ of energy capacity. It weighs about 2.3 kg and can output 15 Amps of continuous power, which gives a maximum of 360 Watts. (I specifically looked for an e-bike battery pack, since they tend to be designed for relatively high power output.) For cooking, let's keep it simple and decide that we just want to boil water, which we can then use for beverages, instant soups, noodles, dehydrated meals, and so on. So we can attach the battery pack to a 24-volt electric immersion heater like this one . It's rated at 200 Watts, well within the capacity of the battery. I don't see a weight specified on this one, but other similar heating elements I've seen online weigh under 100 g, so our whole electric heating set-up is under 2.4 kg. How many hot meals can we make with this set-up? Water has a specific heat capacity of about 4.18 J‚ãÖg ‚àí1 ‚ãÖK ‚àí1 . Let's say that for each meal we want to heat 500 ml of water from 15¬∞C to 100¬∞C. That's going to require 4.18 √ó 500 √ó 85 = 177650 J of energy. Let's round up and call it 200 kJ since the water might be colder and we'll be losing some heat to the pot. As a double-check on this calculation, I just timed my 1 kW kettle bringing 500 ml of 11¬∞C tap water to a rolling boil; it took 210 seconds, so (assuming the power rating is correct) used 210 kJ of energy. Remembering that the battery pack holds 943 kJ and using this higher figure for the water boil, we get 943 / 210 =~ 4.5 half-litre boils from a 2.4 kg electric heating system. Whether this is practical or not depends on the circumstances and personal judgement. On a two-day hike, this set-up would give you at minimum a hot drink every morning, and a hot drink and hot meal every evening. If you can manage on 560 ml of boiling water per day, you could even stretch as far as four days. The 2.4 kg would probably be unthinkable for a hard-core ultralighter, but it's clearly not an impossible weight to carry. For longer hikes, of course, it swiftly becomes impractical. At this point you probably have to start thinking about solar panels for recharging in the wilderness :-). Things are getting better (but very slowly) Lithium-ion technology has been on the market since 1991, with variable but fairly continuous improvements from one year to the next. Energy density tends to increase, on average, by a few percent per year. This makes for significant improvements in the long term: as the graph below from Masias et al. (2013) shows, energy density of the common 18650 battery cell improved by a factor of more than 2.5 between 1991 and 2013: Similar trends can be seen in the data of Jeong et al. (2011) and Pistoia (2014). We can probably expect these marginal improvements to continue at least for a few years more (Tesla seem fairly confident about it, for instance). So our 2.4 kg weekend water-boiler will probably come down below 2 kg in the foreseeable future, but beyond that it's hard to say. Even if lithium-ion energy density could continue to improve indefinitely at 10% per year, it would take over two decades to catch up with ethanol. Would-be electric hikers might do better to pin their hopes on the development of some entirely new battery design. There are plenty of research groups working on potentially revolutionary new battery technologies, but potentially is the key word here: very few bright ideas survive the long journey from notebook to laboratory to factory.

9242,,Why do some fisheries have a lower size limit and others have an upper size limit for keeping fish?,habitat and species specific requiring different tools depending on the outcome desired,"Generally, fisheries management is habitat and species specific requiring different tools depending on the outcome desired, i.e more ""eating size"" fish, more breeding size, more small fry, etc. Adjacent bodies of water may vary significantly in habitat due to fishing pressure, localized impacts (agriculture, human access, etc. This from Minnesota Dept. Natural Resources on walleye fishing might be useful: Though the DNR is just beginning to experiment with special regulations for walleye, it appears likely they will become increasingly important. One kind of special regulation that has been used with other species and may be useful in walleye management is the ""slot"" limit, which protects a certain size fish. For example, anglers may be required to return all fish between 18 and 22 inches but can keep fish outside that slot. The slot limit would allow anglers to keep ""eating-sized"" fish as well as a few trophies. Medium-sized fish would be protected to make for better fishing (not to protect brood stock, which usually exists in sufficient numbers). The number of small fish would be reduced through angling pressure and cannibalism by large walleye. Often, growth rates improve as the small fish become fewer, and the number of large fish increases in this way as well. The secret lies in finding the proper slot for the productivity of the lake and the growth rates of the walleye in it. Success depends on good survey data. What about the familiar minimum-size limit? For example, a regulation may require that all fish under 12 inches be returned to the water. That way, the little ones will have a chance to grow to be big ones, right? Well, no. They'll have the chance to grow to about 113/4 inches and then likely will be yanked from the lake. A minimum-size limit will produce big walleye only if it is pushed up to lunker size--22 inches, for example. That kind of restriction is nearly catch-and-release requirement. Though size restrictions have been a hot topic, there are other ways to limit the kill and improve fishing. see: Wiki link Fishing Slot Limits excerpt : Generally, the purpose behind the implementation of protected slot limits is to improve the angling opportunities in a particular body or bodies of water. Protected slot limits are most often used to regulate the harvest from waters where natural reproduction of the concerned fish species occurs. The protected slot limit is set in such a way that it protects the size of those fish deemed most important to the species spawning success in that fishery. With the size of the most sexually productive fish protected from harvest it is likely that an increased number will spawn during a given year and hence lead to more naturally produced individuals. The effort to increase the number of fish through natural reproduction mitigates the need for artificial stocking of a species to provide for a viable recreational fishery.",habitat and species specific requiring different tools depending on the outcome desired,0.074801154,35,122,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9242

I want to address a slightly more general point: [...] without touching them It should become blatantly clear from what follows (and shouldn't be a debatable point anyway), but to be safe: If anyone does not want to get touched, you don't. However invading the personal space of your climbing partner is not optional . Before climbing you always do a proper partner check and that involves checking manually that biners are locked, harness sits tight, ... That's even true for top-roping. If we are talking about leading (high first bolts) or bouldering, the need for touch becomes even more blatant due to spotting. If the climbers hip gets above your shoulder height, the point of initial contact in case of a fall is the hip. Is this potentially awkward? Sure. Is it better than falling directly on your tailbone from ~2m? I think so. The important point is to explain early and clearly why and in what situation it is necessary to touch or get into the others personal space. It needs to be abundantly clear that it is a safety necessity. Then ask individually when the situation comes up . The consequence is, that if someone legitimately feels uncomfortable about it, you either need to get someone else to do the partner check, or in case of spotting, you just can't do the climb. In general if you can't bear your belayer to touch your harness and hold your behind/back/... in case of a fall while spotting, you might want to rethink whether you want those persons to belay you - they do hold your live in their hands when doing that.",live-demonstration/mirroring recommendations,0.12930271,88,132,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19088
19848,,How can I help birds know how to feed from feeders?,tailoring your feeding habits,"Malaysia has 781 species of birds , but most are not feeder-oriented, which would explain why people don't put up many feeders in your area. There are some, though, and they've probably seen feeders in their travels. Types and location of feeders and foods will bring them to you! Once you have an established group at your feeder, your yard will be a favorite spot and you'll need to order more feeders! According to Attractiveness of Birdfeeders to Birds in the Garden, Malaysia , which studied 15 local species, five were the most attracted to birdfeeders. They were the Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis), Yellow-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier), Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus), Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus), Black-naped Oriole (Oriolus chinensis), Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis). If you have any of those, it seems that you'll have the greatest chance for success. Others will probably come, but tailoring your feeding habits to these will give you that feeling of success as a beginner! Research what types of foods your birds like most. According to a number of sources, the Malaysian version of those birds eat seeds, fruit, and insects. Their preferred seeds are millet, which comes in many colors and sizes. In fact, it looks like that's what's in your feeder, although I can't quite tell. If so, that's excellent! They do like kuaci , which is similar to sunflower seeds, but it's not their 1st choice, as it is with the American and European versions of the same bird. A seed blend including both is a good way to go. Their favorite fruit is papaya, and for protein they like mealworms. This shows a good basic diet. (It's a Malaysian vendor. I have no affiliation, it was just the best way to show you everything in one place.) This page has a good list. Buy in bulk because once your birds are established, steady provision of food will keep them! Try to choose feeders tailored to the needs of your birds. You should try more than one kind. Fill them with seeds. At the same time, sprinkle a lot of the same food on the ground around the feeder. If you have plants or bushes, put the feeder near them, and sprinkle the same food in, underneath, and around them. Many birds are shy or scared at first, and don't know what predators are around. They'd rather eat in the bushes until they feel safe in your yard. Whatever lawn, yard or patio you have, sprinkle the same seeds all around. The purpose is to attract the birds to your yard, then make sure that when they find the feeder, what's in it will taste the same. Water near the feeders is very important. You can use a birdbath, or a dish, no deeper than 2 inches. Be patient, and try not to get discouraged. Birds often take up to two weeks or longer to recognize a new feeder. Even birds who are used to feeders take a while to like a new one. We have 15 feeders, and when we add one, even if it's the same size, shape, and filled with the same food, they ignore it for a few days. Some birds are ground feeders, and won't ever spend much time on the feeder. This is mostly the bigger birds, because their bodies are too awkward to stand on the feeder and grab the food. They'll still hang around though, because you'll be feeding them on the ground. Some birds prefer feeders placed on the ground, according to this source . The theory is that some are more comfortable stationary than on feeders that are blowing in the wind.

Type 3 has a weight limit of 550 lbs and is referred to as 550 paracord. Usually when someone says paracord they are referring to 550 paracord. For bear bags and tying tarps and tents and securing gear 550 paracord works perfectly well and is cheap and readily available. On Military grade 550 paracord the sheath has a weight rating of 300 lbs and has 7 inner strands that are each made up of 3 braided strands. Most commercial 7 strand cord has 2 lines twisted to make each of the 7 inner strands. You can also find commercial variety with a different number of inner strands. If you are looking for something other than 550 paracord the major questions to ask are what diameter do you need and what strength. Almost any where you go from 550 paracord it will get more expensive. For comparison Mammut is a company that makes climbing rope and rates their rope all the way down to 2mm (which is rated for .85kN) and 2mm is usually around $.10/ft.

10937,,How unpleasant is Hypothermia?,deadly,"It's not that bad. First of all, distinguish between hypothermia and frostbite. The latter is when your flesh actually freezes. Water crystals do a lot of damage. It is extremely painful when thawing. If you get cold enough for numbness to set in, that too will be painful on warming. Hypothermia, not so much. First symptoms: The 'umbles: Stumble, Fumble, Mumble. Your fine motor coordination goes. Note: Mumbling may be just caused by cold cheeks and lips. Mumbling in this case is much more like someone who has had too much booze. Involuntary shivering. If you can force yourself to stop with an act of will, you are still ok. In danger, but ok. Sometime in here you stop being rational. Once you stop shivering you are in big trouble. Muscles are too cold to work, which means they have stopped generating much heat. Your body temp drops really fast now. Consciousness fades. As your core cools, heartbeat gets irregular, your lungs start filling (pulmonary edema) and death results. The shivering phase is unpleasant, but not painful. Note that in my outdoor experience I've seen mild to moderate (uncontrolable shivering) on several occasions. The symptoms do not always show up in the same order. Sometimes this may be that no one (including the victim) noticed. Sometimes they just don't happen that way. Some may be the complications of low blood sugar, dehydration, exhaustion. Note that hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will also show the 'umbles and the irrationality. Dehydration also has similar onset. Both make hypothermia more likely, the first because there is less fuel to create heat, the second because the circulation system is sluggish and can't move glucose, O2, and heat around as effectively. In all three cases treatment for early stages: sugar and hot drinks, For hypothermia: dry/more clothing, shelter from wind, more movement if conscious. It does NOT have to be below freezing to die from hypothermia. You can die of hypothermia in 70 degree water. Takes hours. In 50 degree water far less. In 35 degree water you aren't able to do much for yourself after about 20 minutes. Unconsciousness is another 20 minutes or so. For non-water sports, the dangerous temps are around freezing. It's hard to stay dry at those temps. But being immobile on mountain ridge at 50 F in a storm can kill you with hypothermia. Wind makes it worse. It keeps moving the warm air next to your skin away. Wet makes it worse. Water evaporates and cools. It also reduces the effectiveness of insulation. The combination is deadly. Small people (children, women) are more susceptible than larger. Skinny people are more susceptible than fat people. In both cases, the core is closer to the surface. If you get to the cesation of shivering, you have a life threatening situation. If you are far from help the victim is very likely to die. Don't let it get that far. Training: Know the symptoms. Teach the symptoms. Teach the responses. There is merit in going out on a cold windy day, having people peal down then put on a soaking wet t-shirt. Do this near a heated building obviously. Talk about the symptoms as they occur. When someone can't stop shivering, go inside. Have hot drinks and a roaring fire handy. Buddy system. Pair everyone up. Practice calling out ""Buddy Check"" and have people talk to their buddy. Since 'umbles are usually first this is a quick check. More experienced personelle double check. If hiking, the easy way to do this, is to step off the trail and look at faces as they go by. Fall in and chat to any zombies. Do this from the start of the trip to recognize the differences. Keep people hydrated. Lots of people won't drink enough if it's just water with no flavour. Make sure they drink. Train them to notice their pea color. Colourless to light yellow. No problem. Dark yellow to orange. Get them to drink. (Some foods and vitamins will darken your urine.) Keep people fed. Every case of hypothermia I've seen has been near the end of the day when people were running on empty. As leader on day hikes, I always carried a couple of bread and honey sandwiches (easy fuel) If I didn't use them, I took them for lunch the next day. Candy bars work well too.

3125,,How do I recognise quicksand and how do I get out if stuck?,get your pack off and placed/thrown to your side and back,"Hartley's answer on the 'starts sinking' question linked to by @berry120 has the usual guidance for quicksand as well as general boggy/marshy ground. If you are on your own, though, the key thing is to get your rucksack off and get yourself horizontal quickly. If you are vertical, and sinking, gravity will pull you down into the quicksand, but as the human body is less dense than a sand/water mix you will float at or on the surface. If you struggle, you are acting against high viscosity, and possibly a vacuum as you try to pull your legs out of the quicksand, but if you can relax and lie back you will float to the surface and be able to paddle your way back to safety. So - if you feel yourself stuck in quicksand - get your pack off and placed/thrown to your side and back, then try and lie down on the surface of the quicksand and relax. Subsequent to getting out, you will need to retrieve your pack, so keeping a length of rope or cord on you is a good plan. (I especially like the para cord bracelets ) Depending on conditions, you may now need to get warm and dry, so plan for setting camp. As for your last query - the risk is pretty low. If you feel boggy ground, you can often just fall back and be on solid ground.

Here's a link to their page on motion sickness: Motion sickness: First aid Also, in my experience, riding on a multihulled vessel, like a catamaran, greatly reduces the likelihood of seasickness as multihulled vessels do not roll side-to-side in the water as much as monohulled vessels.

As a case study, I can speak from experience with two guidebooks describing hikes and treks in the same region: P√• Fj√§lltur: Abisko Kebnekaise , describes lots of trails in the area around Nikkaluokta and Abisko . They grade trails at a scale of 1‚Äì10. I've found routes graded as ""7/10 difficult"" to be quite easy, routes graded as ""4/10 normal"" to be very easy, and no route is graded below 3/10. Trails described as steep, I found no problem at all. P√• tur i Narvik og omegn , parts I and II, describe many trails and hike in the area around Narvik , just across the Swedish-Norwegian border from Abisko. Hikes are graded on a scale from 1 to 4. I've seen hikes described as ""child-friendly"" that I considered quite scary myself, with lots of boulders, steep slopes where losing balance is fatal, and wild rivers. I've made the mistake of trying a descent described as ""steep"", it was the most vertiginous descent I've ever done and would not recommend it to anyone loving their life. I have some experience with these two guidebooks, so I know what I can do. There's no trail mentioned in the Swedish guidebook (P√• Fj√§lltur) that I would avoid on a backpacking trip, but for many of the trails from the Norwegian book, I would. Subjectively, on a 1-to-1 mapping, I would map any trails from the Swedish book rated 1‚Äì7 to be rated 1 in the Norwegian book, Swedish trails 8‚Äì10 rated 2 or 3 in the Norwegian book, with the Swedish book not containing anything rated 4 in the Norwegian one. Some routes are even described in both books. This is just an example, but for me, it clearly illustrates that there is no universal set of guidelines. It depends very much on the standard and who one keeps in mind.

5152,,How to dry paddling gloves,turned mine inside out,"1.) I would be hesitant to advise you to put them in the dryer. I've never tried or experienced it myself, and my evidence is completely anecdotal , but I've heard that the neoprene has the potential to turn brittle if exposed to forced heating. 2.) The two main things to consider when drying out gloves like this (as well as other things like boots, socks, etc) is this: Absorption - Try to absorb as much water as possible by stuffing them with old newspaper or dry towels. Ventilation/Circulation - You want warm (but not hot), dry air to be able to reach the wet surfaces of the gloves. I've turned mine inside out and they seemed to dry faster, but it depends on how rigid and easily inside-out-able your gloves are. If you can prop them up, get them next to a warm air vent if you've got one. Another tip (although this wasn't asked in the question) is to keep the smell from neoprene things like this (they often start to smell pretty bad if sweat is allowed to sit in them for too long) is to dry them out thoroughly every time. If you've sweated pretty heavily in them, gently rinse them with cool water and possibly mild soap depending on the material and then let them dry. This will prolong the life of your gear and make them not stink like a sock. EDIT: To answer the addition to your question: I think silica gel could certainly help, and I've got a friend who has used it successfully on hiking boots, but it definitely took a lot longer than the absorption/air drying method.",turned mine inside out,0.117339879,597,619,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5152
6004,,How to use campus boards,one hand at a time,"Moving up a 1 cm wide campus board one hand at a time is on par with the intensity of V4/V5 boulder moves, approximately. So unless you're very comfortable bouldering in this range, it's not suggested because you will probably injure yourself. If you are past this phase, then campusing is a very good training tool for increasing strength and power in a very focused manner, compared to just climbing random routes at a gym. I don't agree with the previous answer that it's just for people who climb better than 7c (5.12d/V9-ish)--you can definitely incorporate it into your workout long before then with moderation. Unlike climbing routes at a gym, which have lots of different styles, campusing allows you to very quantitatively monitor your progress . One week you can only hang on a rung for 2 seconds; next week you're up to 5 seconds--that is well-defined progress. It's also more efficient compared to climbing in some respects because of its high intensity. Here are some training exercises that the campus board is good for (Note: all should be done with an open-hand grip): Deadhangs What: Hang from a rung of the campus board for 5-15 seconds x 5-10 reps. As this gets easier, you can add weight, move to smaller rungs, do more reps, hang for longer time, use <4 fingers per hand, etc. Why: Increase your finger strength and endurance for holding onto small holds statically Lock-offs What: There's variations to this, but you want to start hanging with both hands on a rung, then reach up with one hand a couple of rungs and go back down. Why: Lock-offs are used often in climbing. This exercise develops your lats and shoulder muscles so you can reach up higher from a small handhold. You also develop power from exploding off the starting rung. Double Dynos What: Start hanging on the campus board, then dyno up with both hands to the next rung, all the way to the top. Maybe wait til you're at V6s before doing these. Why: Develop power and strengthen fingers to handle these dynamic moves. Also, develop hand-eye coordination. Laddering What: Just move up the campus rungs, one hand at a time. You can either match hands or not on each rung. For added difficulty, skip rungs. Why: Most similar to normal climbing movement, develop general strength and power.",one hand at a time,0.500359416,35,53,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6004
7333,,How to clean hiking boots,drag my boots through them,"My boots are leather, as you've not stated what yours are made of at time of writing, here goes with what I do to clean my boots on walks and to store at home. Firstly for at home I will always leave my boots to dry off usually overnight - just on some newspaper away from any radiators or the fire, slow drying as they are leather. It's easier to remove dry dirt than wet. Once dry I'll bang my boots together to remove the worst of the mud, if I'm off out again there is no point doing more than this. If not, I'll then use a soft bristled brush to get as much mud off the leather and soles as possible. Next I'll wipe them over with a slightly damp cloth or kitchen roll, this leaves the leather clean enough so that I can reapply a protective coating - something like NikWax for leather. They then live in a hiking boot bag. On route and out camping, well this depends. I have two tents, one is larger with living area separate to sleeping so I don't really mind leaving my boots in there, the other is much smaller with only a little area outside for bags and boots. I aim to never step inside the actual tent with my muddy boots (this helps keep as much mud from getting in the tent as possible) but to clean them I will do little more than find some damp long grass (dry works but damp is better) and drag my boots through them. We do this a lot when out walking in the British countryside as you will get a lot of farmland and it's better than leaving mud on a fence post. Also I will stomp a little in standing water - a puddle on the roadside for example, again this only helps if you have one, but helps get rid of the mud on the sole of your boot. If you're lucky with the weather on hikes and camping you should be able to dry your boots over night and bang them together in the morning to remove as much mud as possible. If you have the space for a microfibre cloth you could probably give them a good wipe over if you want to - but if you're going to get muddy again the next day then I'd say don't bother, just clear as much mud off the sole of the boot (a knife works as well, not a sharp one, or a stick to clear your sole out) so that you can stand evenly without discomfort. The best and easiest way I've ever cleaned my boots is to go for a walk in the snow, they come back sparkling. I'll leave them to dry, apply NikWax and they're good as new.

13561,,How to throw a tomahawk,get a traditional throwing tomahawk made for this purpose,"How to throw a tomahawk? First of all get a traditional throwing tomahawk made for this purpose. Never try throwing an axe, a camping hatchet or a non-throwing tomahawk. Tomahawk Throwing People familiar with tomahawks and their use often refer to them as ""hawks"". Similarly, terms like pipe-tomahawk have been shortened to pipe-hawk. Tomahawk targets frames are usually called hawk-boards or hawk-blocks. The average tomahawk has a blade up to 4 inches wide at the cutting edge and a handle from 14 to 20 inches long. (See Fig. 1) Weights run from half a pound to three pounds. The average throwing hawk weighs a little less than two pounds. A forged blade is preferred as it can be readily sharpened with a file and will take considerable abuse without breaking. Handles, however, are not as forgiving and should be considered, at least to some extent, expendable items. This is especially true during the learning period. The sides of the handle should be thinner. This helps in holding the hawk straight and in grasping it the same way every time. The handles on most good quality hawks are a drive fit down through the eye of the blade. The handle, therefore, should also be tapered to some degree. Some hawks are drilled and a pin is driven through the eye of the blade and the handle. This often tends to weaken the handle and encourage splitting. The best way to install a handle to a blade is to make sure the wood of the handle is as dry as possible when they are driven together. Normal moisture will cause the wood to swell slightly to make the fit all the more snug. The blade does tend to slide down the handle from time to time through usage. This usually occurs when the handle end of the hawk strikes the target first. When this happens, merely drive the blade back on the handle until it is snug again. Since most hawk throwing is done at a minimum distance of 12 feet, measure off that distance from a suitable target and then take one full step back. Stance The suggested stance is feet comfortable side by side. The weight should be shifted to the right foot, assuming you're right handed, just before throwing. At the same time as the swing of the throwing arm, step forward with the left leg. The action of the feet is not unfamiliar to that of a man throwing a ball. Some people find it more natural to reverse the footwork and step forward with the right leg. Choose whichever is more comfortable and natural to you. Grip and Release Take hold of your tomahawk as you would hold a tack hammer. The thumb should be at the side of the handle while the fingers are wrapped around the handle. (See Fig. 2) Point the hawk, cutting edge down, and the throwing arm fully extended towards the target. The throwing arm is then raised over the shoulder without fully bending the elbow. When the arm is brought down to a near horizontal position, (see Fig. 3) the fingers are opened for the release. At the moment of release, when the fingers are opened, the position of the hand is similar to the appearance of a hand being offered in a handshake. Be careful not to twist the wrist as this will make the hawk go somewhat sideways. Use mostly arm motion and a minimum of wrist action. Don't try to throw too hard. The average hawk, if sharp, will almost stick of it's own weight. Power, speed and more important, accuracy will come with time and practice.

This can make it less visible. Even in more conventional non-luxury sailboats the fact that everything is neatly routed along the deck helps in reduce cluttering and not make the sailboat look like a man of war when you look at it (and there's a reason many boatowners are neat freaks, even if just when it comes to the boat) Some hardware designed just to be flush with the deck and the use of electrical components also allows less conspicuous placement of some equipment. Some components can easily enough be completely located below deck, like furling gear, and they can be also operated manually from above deck in case of failure.. In some solutions only part of the system is routed below, like the placement of the traveler tackle in the Farr40. Often whats routed below are just all the ""ropes"" and, wanting, this can be designed into smaller affordable sailboats (I suspect some small boat owners would not like to have to maintain such a system).

14468,,How to learn route setting?,trial and error,"It is a lot of trial and error. Setting bouldering problems tends to be easier since they are shorter. The biggest thing to consider is height. Assuming you are reasonably tall individual, solicit feedback from some of the strong junior climbers. They will often be able to tell you where they need an extra foot chip to make a reach or even use it as a hand hold to make a bump. One rule of thumb is if you cannot make the reach with your elbow, the move is too long. If you are short, it is often very hard to judge just how far a tall person can reach. Another thing to consider is injury potential. Reaches around features can cause people to bend in weird ways and odd body parts to rub against the wall. No one likes banging an elbow/knee when they fall or rubbing their wrist raw. Gimmick moves are over rated. I would avoid trying to set move that requires a knee bar, figure four, dyno, or heel hook. Just stick with straight forward moves that flow. Setting below your max grade is much easier than setting at, or even worse above, your max climbing grade. Everyone needs to warm up so good easy routes/problems will not go to waste. Overly tweaking a move is generally not a good thing. If the quality/difficulty of the move changes drastically with a few degree change in a hold, it is probably not a great move. Eventually, the clean hold will get slimy and it might even twist a bit, essentially reversing all your tweaking. Further everyone climbs differently and has different reaches and balance points. Making a move fit you exactly, or not fit you, does not mean it will fit/not fit other people. Makes routes consist of moves of consistent difficulty (and quality).

You'll need a skin will cover nearly the whole ski base, and that won't slide easily at all (I think my skins require more than 10¬∞ of slope to go downhill). Because of that friction, you will not experience much that resembles cross country skiing, except for maybe some skating type action. Without skins the skis will give you no grip, you'll have to use poles & skating to go anywhere. Ideally your route will not have any long flat sections. A skill you might work on is going uphill with all that weight on your feet. You won't need to lift your foot for every step, as long as the skis tips stay on top of the snow, so that's just a matter of exercise. You will probably have to change direction on steep slopes, meaning lift one ski out, turn it ~180¬∞ then transfer your weight onto it, while your poles are sinking into that bottomless powder. This can get quite awkward and a little frustrating, so I'd practice that before committing to a long day in the back country. For the downhill part, you'll get conditions similar to groomed snow during the spring, which is easy enough. Depending on where you are you might get deep powder, very chunky sun cups, avalanche debris that's like rubble, or inch-thick ice. You can practice skiing those while in-bounds, if your local ski resort isn't too obsessive about grooming. As ab2 said, get some avalanche training, and find out about your local avalanche forecast.

Also bear in mind that in many cases improvised traps may be illegal (in a non-emergency situation) so it may not be possible to test them in real world conditions. Trapping is not just about being able to build the trap itself, you also need local knowledge of animal behaviour and geography to have a decent chance of a trap being effective for example knowing what species are in a particular area, which are worth targeting and where to place a trap for it to be effective. The big advantage of trapping it that it can provide you with high energy food for relatively little physical effort. Equally in a longer term situation just the fact of doing something positive to improve your situation can be an important psychological factor and any success at all will be a big moral boost. Whether or not it is worth your time to learn is really up to you to decide. It is fairly unlikely that you will end up in a situation where lack of food becomes a life or death issue and you also have the opportunity to set up traps.

15609,,How dangerous are wild horses?,very unpredictable,"Obviously, since horses are animals, they are relatively predictable (they have known behaviour patterns), but can be very unpredictable (they are autonomous creatures). Note first that horses are not predators. In other words, they're not out there to get you. The only case in which they become a threat to humans is when they feel that you are a threat to them. Even at that, in general, they are somewhat like deer; if they feel threatened, their first instinct is to evade the danger. However, they are tougher animals then deer, and they are well aware that they can defend themselves to some extent: their legs are so powerful they could kill you. (Reference) So the answer to your first question is, yes, horses can be dangerous to humans if they feel threatened. In answer to your second question, the major aspect of protection is prevention. Keep a safe distance between you and any wild horses you come across - this article suggests 50 feet as a good minimum distance. Obviously, the more horses there are, the less threatened they will tend to feel, therefore keep a greater distance. There's not a lot you can do as far as protective gear is concerned, short of carrying a weapon (I don't recommend). Pepper spray or other chemical solutions won't do a lot of good since they're coming at you. You might get the horse, but he might run you over in his terror. Bottom line: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Play it safe. Don't get too close to wild horses (no close-ups with a 50 prime), don't make loud noises: avoid frightening them in any way.

20292,,How common are avian diseases?,relatively common,"I'm a virologist (mostly flu), so I can answer for that and other viruses, but birds also host a range of bacterial and fungal and protozoan pathogens which can make you sick or even kill. These include things like salmonella (bacterial), chlamydia (bacterial), cryptosporidium (protozoan), aspergillus (fungal), and candida (yeast fungus) In addition, birds often have things like lice and/or ticks that can host other infectious agents such as rickettsia, tularemia and a whole host of insect borne viruses. The risk of getting ill depends on the type of bird, how abundant they are around you and how close the contact you are having is, and the type of disease - if you are handling dead or sick animals with bare hands and without washing your hands afterward, you are at great risk! Some infections will present with very obviously sick animals (e.g. highly pathogenic influenza), others are a part of the natural microflora of the species you are interacting with (e.g. salmonella), and as such the animals will often not show signs of infection. Infections that have a zoonotic (come from animals) cause are relatively common , not least because many people have interactions with animals on a daily basis. A large portion of these zoonoses are a result of contamination of food stuffs with feces or from eating undercooked meat from an animal. Having said that - what are the risks of feeding wild birds? Well, the answer is that we don't really know. Sometimes the risk will be higher than others, due to a wave of infection passing through the local population. So, what do we know about infections in people who work closely with birds? Quite a lot for some diseases like salmonella and influenza, but not a lot for many other, less dramatic, diseases. Immune surveys that investigate people who work with ducks and chickens in the wet markets of Asia show that they have somewhere between 0 % and 10% prevalence for H5N1 (""bird flu"", highly pathogenic often, summary in the paper linked) based on sero-conversion (this is the immune system recognizing the virus and protecting you against it), but this is only one strain of the range of influenza viruses and comprehensive studies are rare and difficult to conduct due to the ubiquity of influenza in the human population, so the actual number may be much higher once you take the other strains of influenza into account. The reason we can study H5 influenza is because it is not naturally found in humans - so we can look at the presence of antibodies and know that they came from a zoonotic event. Now, this doesn't tell us much about the risk of getting sick - most of these people who have the antibodies against H5 didn't get sick and certainly weren't among the 1500 or so people who died from the virus.

If it doesn't then be sure to remove the head rather than just leave it in there. Then clean the area with alcohol and be sure to keep an eye on it in case any rashes or other untoward symptoms appear. The likelihood of this depends on the area but it always pays to be aware. I wouldn't recommend the commonly cited more ""violent"" approaches such as burning the tick or trying to twist it out. That will often do more harm than good and has a greater chance of leaving the head still embedded in the skin. If you're worried about potential diseases then be sure to preserve the tick so it can be analysed later by a lab if necessary to determine any infections it may have been carrying.

411,,How to deal with wet feet?,Keeping feet dry,"After dealing with a lot of wet feet issues I have learned some tricks. Keeping feet dry While hiking, use gaitors that come above your socks and divert water away from the wicking material. Keep your boots well oiled, using a product like Nikwax, or minkoil. This keeps the leather from absorbing water as much. In normal conditions (not marsh hiking) use baking soda or similar powder to absorb the natural sweat from your feet. There are impermeable ""bags"" you can put over you foot while wearing a liner sock, then put your foot into a medium weight sock. The bag keeps out water, but also keeps in sweat. Note that once the humidity within the bag reaches 100% your foot will stop sweating. Getting feet dry, after being wet. Carry extra shoes in any backcountry travel which breath well, and are light. Keep them totally dry through the day in a bag. My favorite are crocs, because they are simple, light, and cannot absorb water. Keep one pair of socks for sleeping, and nothing else. The best material for these are full synthetic, not wool or cotton, since the polyester cannot absorb water. Provide enough time for your feet to completely dry out each night. Don't go tromping around camp in your ""dry"" socks, they are for the tent and sleeping bag only. Drying Wet Socks Place them around your neck, or over your chest and they will be dry in the moring. If you are a heavy sweater wear a silk weight shirt and pants to absorb and wick moisture, or place socks on top of sleeping bag. Hang socks from ""in tent"" drying line if the air temperature is high and humidity is low. If not the socks will not dry at all.",Keeping feet dry,0.174280107,72,88,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/411

Different things work for different people. It's important to find out what works for you. This can be done with experimentation or the help of a specialist.

I say pay particular attention to how you're walking while wearing your walking shoes that do not give you any problems. Then walk around in your sandals or your boots. Pay attention to how your feet land in the different footwear, and how you transition to your next stride. Find the stride that works best for you and practice it. I know it's strange to have to think about walking again, it's supposed to be something we just do, but I find it helps me.

That said, there are several situations that cause me to re-wax my skis (and we are talking about PTEX based alpine-style skis here, with a melted-in base wax, rather than hand-applied glide waxes used on cross-country or nordic skis): Beginning of the season - great time to get a solid base wax down, repair dings from the previous year, lube the bindings, etc. I establish a ""cold"" temperature wax for the cold, dry early winter conditions in Colorado.

Make sure you dry your shoes properly between uses by hanging them out, and don't keep them in a bag/trunk/confined space. During your climbing session, it's a good idea to take your shoes off between climbs (at least once in a while) to let them dry out some. For odor control , I find that spray deodorizers can do a good job. I don't think I would use powders, but I'm curious what everyone else says. Once things get really bad, you can give shoes a wash (by hand) using warm water, a mild detergent, and a brush of some sort (an old toothbrush works fine). Wash the insides thoroughly using the brush and soap, it'll take a few rinses to get everything. Allow the shoes to dry completely, put them next to a fan/heater (but not too close). Stuff the shoes with newspaper, and change it often. Generally, I find some brands to be worse for odors than others. I've had good luck with La Sportiva, and a terrible time with Evolvs. This is most likely because of the material (leather vs. synthetic).

4864,,How to use a Rap Ring,lets you avoid leaving behind a locking biner,"It's not complicated. Let's say you're using a long piece of webbing to build the anchor. Before you tie the ends of the webbing to make a loop, you put the webbing through the rap ring. Then when you form the loop, the ring is linked into it. When you form the master point of the anchor (i.e., the loop that you would normally put a locking biner through), you do it so that the rap ring is there in the master point. Now you rappel off of the rap ring. To make sure you don't lose the rope, you go through the usual procedure of tying the middle of the rope to something before you throw the ends down. Then before you rap off, you remove the knot so that you'll be able to pull the rope down at the bottom. All you're leaving behind is the webbing and the rap ring, both of which are cheap to replace. Having the rap ring lets you avoid leaving behind a locking biner, which is more expensive.

5599,,How to get started on canyoning?,to try to locate someone more experience with whom you can go,"Although theoretically one can do canyoneering alone, in reality it's not something you can safely start doing all by yourself, especially since you don't have mountaineering or rock climbing experience. So the first thing to do is to try to locate someone more experience with whom you can go. Canyoneering can be dangerous, basically because it involves lots of rappelling. If you read Accidents in North American Mountaineering for a randomly chosen year, you will see lots and lots of rappelling accidents. Canyoneering is also difficult to do safely because a trip down a canyon is committing. Once you've done the first rappel, you generally have no choice but to complete the remaining rappels. If you get to a certain rappel and find that the anchor is unsafe, you have a serious problem. Wet canyoneering adds to the danger. For all these reasons, it would be extremely foolish for someone with your skill set to try to do this without guidance from someone who is going to be there with you. Assuming that you're going with someone else who is more experienced, the minimum personal equipment you would need for yourself would be a climbing harness, pear-shaped locking carabiner, rappel device, helmet, cordage for making a backup Prusik , and some kind of Prusik (such as a Texas Prusik) to carry on your harness in case something goes wrong and you need to ascend the rope. The other person would presumably provide rope, rope bag, webbing for anchors, extra oval carabiners for misc purposes, and other shared equipment. To build up a minimal set of skills, it would be a good idea to do a little rock climbing, either at a gym or outdoors. You should buy the standard textbook on mountaineering, called Freedom of the Hills, and study the chapter on rappelling extremely carefully. You also need to learn how to ascend a rope on a Prusik and how to stop a rappel with a leg wrap. There are some additional skills that your leader might have, but that it would also be good for you to have. These including building an emergency rappel setup and building an anchor. Anchor building is an extremely technical skill. Although you may intend to go on canyoneering routes where all the anchors are supposed to be pre-built (e.g., there are bolts at every rappel station), in reality you can't assume that they will all be OK. If you get there and the anchor is damaged or appears unsafe, you need to know enough to deal with the situation.",to try to locate someone more experience with whom you can go,0.180697337,232,293,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5599
5672,,How to preserve cheese while backpacking?,carry it always in this towel,"Additional to the two great answers already given I want to share my own experience, repeating some things and adding some: Choose your Cheese carefully As already mentioned, harder cheese will last longer. Good sorts (I don¬¥t know if available outside Europe): Parmesan, Manchego, ""Bergk√§se"". The cheese will start to mold on the surface. Take this into account, bring large pieces instead of many small (or even slices). Don¬¥t take cheese with holes with you. As already mentioned by others cheese with a peeling of wax or of other kind will be a better choice since this part of the surface is covered. I haven¬¥t tried it yet, but I would refrain from bringing mold cheese (like Roquefort)in warm to hot climates/seasons since their taste will get stronger very fast and its hardly to predict how their (non-harming) mold will grow and affect spoiling. Vegan ""cheese"" may be an alternative for you, since it is less prone to molding, especially if you want cheese stretch for pizza or pasta. However, conventional hard cheese should still be better. Keep your cheese cold Heat will make your cheese sweat and mold. This makes it easy to carry cheese in winter, but challenging in hot climates. Some tips for keeping it cold: The refrigerating device suggested by Kate is great. If you don¬¥t have a lake or stream at your disposal, you can try putting it under stones or something alike. Just make sure it doesn¬¥t get eaten by animals - mice and racoon will open most bags, also plastic ones. During daytime (in case you are moving), put it at the coldest spot available. Deep in your backpack, it can maintain a cold temperature for quite a long time, especially if you put it near water reserves (e.g. a hydration pack/camelbag). If your paddling, the bottom of your canoe/kayak will be quite cold and a good guess. However, this may conflict with the next point Keep your Cheese dry Moisture is as bad as heat. While you don¬¥t want to put it in a plastic bag (see also next point), you definitely don¬¥t want it to get wet, as it makes it mold a lot faster. You could put it in a permeable bag and then, together with other stuff (food or clothes, while the latter will probably start to smell) in a bigger, water-proof bag. This will prevent it from sweating as well as from getting wet. Put it in a prepared cloth I read about this technique for storing it and have tried it out with great success: Take a clean cloth (e.g. a towel) big enough to wrap your piece of cheese. Soak it in vinegar and let it dry off. If you want to make sure its soaked, you can repeat this. Now (after drying it thoroughfully!) wrap your cheese and carry it always in this towel. It's the best way to store it, the cloth is now kind of antiseptic and will repel mold and is, on the other hand, very permeable.

5688,,How to dry wet shoes quickly?,"shoes with cloth uppers that therefore breath easily, and fairly thick wool socks","Consider whether you really need to have dry shoes before going thru all the trouble. In the winter, wet footwear can be a serious problem. However, when it's warm out there is really no danger from wet shoes. The only issue may be that you simply don't like the feel of it. In situations where its warm enough and there is no real danger from wet shoes, keeping the shoes dry is not necessarily the best answer. Here in New England, trails regularly have wet areas when they aren't frozen. The way I often deal with this is to decide up front that I simply don't care if my shoes get wet. It's actually quite liberating to not worry about it. It makes getting thru wet areas and crossing stream much easier. There are a few things that help make this work, mostly being the right shoes and the right socks. I use shoes with cloth uppers that therefore breath easily, and fairly thick wool socks. Thick wool socks versus thin cotton or other synthetic make a huge difference. With this setup it's really not uncomfortable at all to walk in wet shoes. You don't get that sloppy squishy feeling, and I've never gotten blisters or felt any rubbing due to the wetness. On the plus side, you feel much freer to just walk around anywhere. You stop worrying about getting wet, finding ways around large puddles in the middle of the trail, when the beavers have flooded the road with 2 inches of water, crossing streams, etc. All around it makes for more enjoyable hiking.

5994,,How do you mount ski bindings?,precise process,"For most people, having a shop do the mount is a hassle-free and relatively inexpensive way to mount bindings. Shops will often mount the ski ""on the line"" but many will mount it to your basic specifications. Why mount yourself? In my experience, the main reason someone would choose to mount their own ski bindings is that they want to mount older but still serviceable bindings that a shop refuses to deal with, they want to do a custom mount involving binding inserts, swap plates, quiver killers, or they want to use multiple boots and mount the binding in a way that multiple BSLs (boot sole lengths) would fit, which would not work in a standard mount. Tools & Templates A binding mount can usually be done with some C-clamps, epoxy, masking tape, a power drill, some bits, and a binding template. It is difficult to provide templates here as they are usually printable in PDF form and specific to the binding make and model. They are available online from sites such as: Binding Freedom , or Slide Wright both of which I've used in the past. An important thing with templates is to ensure they are printed to scale. Risks As the comments above mentioned, mounting skis is a somewhat precise process, which definitely embodies the adage ""measure twice, cut once"". Common risks are: drilling too many holes and turning your skis into ""Swiss cheese"" thus making them very fragile, drilling through the ski if you aren't careful, or incorrectly measuring by enough of a margin so that you can't click in. Tutorials General tutorials are available online, in fact my friend and I have written several from our first few mounting experiences. I'll try to summarize the steps very briefly here. Extensive tutorials including video can be found at: Binding Freedom Tutorials , Teton Gravity Forums , Wild Snow articles , or articles here , here , and here . Basic Summary Acquire the following: power drill, printed template, epoxy, a sharpie, drill bits slightly smaller than the binding screws (~3.6 mm), a pilot hole bit, a ruler, C-clamps, and a sturdy table. Clamp the ski to the table. Find the center of the ski ""on the line"", the line printed on the ski from the factory. Align the binding template, centered on the center point, and tape it down. Measure a lot. Optional: Visually check by placing bindings over template and putting the boot in. Center-punch the template hole marks to ensure the bit won't skip on the ski's surface. Once you are sure on the placement, tape a ""stopper"" around your drill bit(s) at about 9mm (standard wood screw thread length). Drill some holes.

Tents are supposed to keep you warm, and not the other way round. If you are doing that more often then I'd say you have the wrong gear being used at the wrong place. Yet, there may rise a situation when you need to do it, there are ways to do it, but honestly you'll need to be very careful and cautious about them. Firstly, Larger tents require more heating, and require more insulation to keep the heat in. The weather will keep on making it cold, so I'll say as a preventive measure you should try and arrange something that can keep you warm, and then may be think about having something that keeps the whole tent warm from inside. Its always necessary to have a insulation between you and the ground, you can do that by means of using air mattresses and inflatable sleeping pads, these are convenient to carry. This was more like a corrective measure just in case if you fail to keep your tent warm. As an additional measure you can put a lukewarm water bottle in the sleeping bag before getting into bed. You can built a small fire in front of the tent at a distance with a flat rock set up as a heat reflector. Wake up once in a while and check if everything is good and in control. But IMHO, You sleep way better when not having to worry about your heat source sometimes. I do this when its absolutely cold, and I am no longer able to sleep. You could consider a newly introduced thing called a catalytic heater or this that are safe to use in an enclosed area, and are made specifically for car camping when things get cold.

All I would do no is boil the skull for a bit (outside, some BBQs having heating elements that work good for this) to disinfect it and soften up any grime you may need to scrub off (use a bottle cleaning brush to get up inside the skull and scrub away any leftovers) then proceed to whitening the skull. Whitening is best done with Hydrogen Peroxide, you can use the over the counter stuff from the drug store, or you can buy the heavy duty stuff from a taxidermist. just soak the skull in a tub overnight or for a day or two (no longer or you can start to ruin the skull) then let it dry for about the same amount of time. After your skull is nice and white, you can superglue any loose teeth back in place, and finish your skull with a spray coat of clear wood finish. Of course you could always give your local taxidermist a call to see how much he would charge you to clean them up himself, you'd be surprised how cheap they'll do some jobs, it would probably be good to consult them about the condition of the bone either way.",bottle cleaning brush,0.201107904,1149,1170,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7114
7943,,How do membrane-based boots breathe?,"saturated fast, and if it's saturated your boot won't breath","The salesperson explained that leather keeps much warmer, but has no effect on breathability or water proof-ness Well he's not really correct there, so breathability is based no the concept that moisture will pass from a high saturation of moisture (next to your skin) to a low saturation of moisture (the outside). The temperature is also important, the high saturation area needs ot be a higher temperature to the outer (that's what the DWR helps with in a goretex jacket) The Goretex material facilitates these process with pores that that allow water (in the correct state) out but not in. So if the water is trapped inside to the goretex layer (i.e by the outer fabric) this will obviously lower the ability of the moisture to pass though the goretex layer and therefore make the boot less breathable. Leather is not as breathable as fabric. Air/moisture, etc. does not pass though leather as well as fabric. It is breathable but not as breathable. If there was a ""pocket"" between the membrane and the outside shell, which I don't think it does, this is going to become saturated fast, and if it's saturated your boot won't breath. This is what a vapour barrier is but that works totally different to a breathable shoe. So I would suggest that breathability is going to be better in fabric boots than leather ones. That said, he is correct that leather is warmer, so it's a a balancing act, warmth vs breathability. How much this is effected is debatable but it will have an effect. He is correct that the outer has little input into the water proofoness of a gore text boot, that's what the goretex layer does. Obviously none goretex boots are different.

9485,,How much should your backpack weigh?,under 15 lbs,"The ideal weight is zero. The less weight you carry the more you will enjoy your outing. That being said, one should try to minimize their weight within reason. There exist different schools (Ultralight, super-ultralight, etc.) on what one should carry and how much it should weight. REI suggest the following categories: minimalist - Under 12 pounds (~5.5kg) ultralight - Around 20 pounds (~9kg)*** lightweight - Up to 30 pounds (~13.5kg) plush/deluxe - Over 30 pounds *** Typically, in the UL community ultra light is defined as under 10 pounds (~4.5kg). With the popularity of the ultra light movements some big manufactures and stores started branding certain equipment as ultralight although they would be considered too heavy by many UL backpackers. It is easier to compare packing weights by dividing the weight of items which will remain constant over the course of the trip and the ones who will vary such as consumable items (food, water, etc.). The constant weight is called the base weight. Super Ultralight (SUL) backpackers aim for a base weight of under 5lbs (2.3 kg). Often this is very dependent on the trip location and weather. On the other extreme, soldiers can carry from 40-90+ lbs (~18‚Äì40+kg) on missions. My subjective suggestion is the following: I would aim for a base weight of under 15 lbs (~6.8 kg) . With food and water included I would aim for under 30lbs (~13.5 kg) and at 20 lbs (~9 kg) I'm a happy hiker heading to town. It's important to bear in mind that water weights 2.2lbs (1 kg) per liter and is a big factor in the total weight. Depending on the availability of reliable water sources your total backpack weight may be greatly affected. Food usually is about 2 lbs (nearly 1 kg) per day.

Usually bird baths are actually kind of shallow, or rather the edges usually are dipping gently into a deeper pool in the middle. This kind of dish on a balcony would suffice. Our multipurpose bird feeder came with a rather small waterbowl. About 8 inches diameter and 1 inch deep, this does suffice as well and I have seen birds drink from it but never bathe. I think this is due to the fact it's got vertical edges. There is a slight issue with leaving water out in so far as the hotter it gets the faster it will evaporate and therefore in a sense it will be a waste (taking into account a water shortage). You can also get water drinkers though. These act exactly like a chickens water bowl, and should still suit most birds.

9779,,How to fold rope for storage?,fold it back over the whole coil,"As mentioned in comments, this option to coil a rope will get you some twists in it. So I do not recommend it for longer ropes (i.e. your climbing ropes), as twists are very inconvenient when belaying. This mode is mainly suited for cordelettes that you want to attach to your harness and therefore should be compact. To create such a coil follow these steps: Start with the two ends together in your hand. Depending on length and diameter wrap your cord neatly around a hand or around an elbow and the crest between the index and thumb until only a small amount is left. Wrap the rest tightly starting at one end making your way towards the other. I usually do not do this over the whole length, I just start in the middle as for my taste it still gets compact enough (I am lazy). To secure the ending there are two options: a) Leave only very little space at the end and then simply pull the cord through and clip this loop to a biner - fast and does not get loose as long as it is on the biner. b) Use just enough rope to pull it through the end and then fold it back over the whole coil. This is neat even without a biner, but is somewhat more tedious to do and has no obvious attachment loop, so it is more suited for storage. For long and/or big diameter ropes I recommend to use some variant of the butterfly coil (just google it, there are lots of instructions available).

You do that because you might draw a little bit further than your actual draw length. This is pretty dangerous cause the arrow might penetrate the hand which holds the bow! I would recommend to generally add 2 inches for an absolute beginner. This would be 31"" in your case. Why?: You might have a bad form yet and thus your draw length might extend a little bit as soon as you get better It's safe (in terms of ""slip off and hit the bow hand"" at least) You'll need a lot of arrows in the first few months (especially if you are a 3D shooter). In case your arrow breaks, you have a chance that there'll be only 1"" missing: you still have a 30"" arrow :) ( Note: Only reuse the arrow if the other rest of the shaft is still absolutely perfect and you use carbon arrows ) You might want to use another anchor in the future which could result in an extended draw length Credits: http://www.learn-archery.com Later on you want to ""tune"" your arrows.

First, why would it happen, how do you know whats happening: Do we normally catch cold, runny nose when its cold outside? Normally we do. ""How much cold"" can vary from person to person though. Getting runny nose is one of the body's defense mechanisms. Phlegm is the substance that contains mucus (a protective substance) and other bacteria, bluntly saying which is produced by Respiratory System, to be precise by Mucus Membranes. Respiratory Mucus protects the whole Respiratory tract and the lungs by trapping foreign particles that are inhaled through the nose when we breathe. It also helps to heat-up the inhaled air before it reaches the lungs. So, If you have a runny nose, its okay. Still try and breathe through Nose and not through mouth. Obviously, it is going to be difficult to breathe through nose and so doing a strenuous tasks with same efficiency as normal is a difficult task to pull off. You are not supposed to exert. Important: Don't choose to clean up your nose by means of Otrivin or similar products and continue getting into colder regions. This would make you feel better, but only for a while. Should you continue with your task, getting into colder regions thinking that you have now knocked the running nose issue off and are now good to get colder, Beware, it may result in constricting bronchial tubes which would exert lungs a lot and would definitely make breathing a lot difficult. Common symptoms of such a situation is coughing up blood. Taa-dan, you need help now. (May be not entirely needed for this answer, but interesting: Why would lungs exert, its because you don't warm your lungs enough, Mucus around the Lung Fibers and tissues isn't enough, the bronchial muscles get dry, resulting in constriction.) Get into warmer conditions. Continue to breathe through nose. Take cloth, breath-out/exhale through mouth on it, and put it on your nose, feels warm and better.

Your local club should be able to give you all the info for your area and abroad if they organize group dives in other countries, otherwise just contact the destination dive club (and keep in mind that in some places the situation might change from one year to the other). As a general rule most countries tend to have a maximum length for a blade above which you could face charges if carrying it on the person in any circumstance, or in the car. If your gear is packed up in your car and the knife is in there with the kit generally it is not a problem since very often, carrying a blade longer than what is allowed can pass if there is a valid (and legal) reason for it. For example in Canada or parts of Europe a cop stopping me won't give much trouble if he sees the axe, camp knife etc all packed up with camping gear and a canoe/kayak on the roof of the car, or if the dive knife is in the trunk with all my diving equipment. I can see somebody having a problem if it's just a pool session, debatable if you are up to it. It always helps, if stopped, to tell right away things like ""I'm a diver, all my diving gear is in the trunk"". It goes a long way in reducing the chances of the person stopping you, or if you are passing a border with the car, becoming picky and giving trouble (this goes even if you are on foot and the knife is in the bag with all the gear). The fact that the knife is in a bag way out of your reach helps too; don't keep it in your glovebox or under the seat. It also helps if the knife is one of those with the blunted tip and not the ones looking like they just came off a gladiator of ancient Rome.

11318,,"How quickly do Oxygen Absorbers ""spoil""?",when all the iron in them has oxidized,"Depends somewhat on what type of absorber you're using, but they're most commonly made from iron powder, which are good for hours between first opening and sealing in your bags, but that time can be extended to days, weeks or longer if you keep the unused ones in an airtight container like a jar, or some other container with a rubber seal. Oxygen absorbers remove oxygen from their surrounding atmosphere by chemical reaction. Simply explained, most are filled with an iron and salt compound that rusts when it's exposed to oxygen and humidity, and the oxidization eats up all the O 2 . They are pretty much miniature hand warmer heat packs, and will actually become warm to the touch when they are working. This isn't a fast process, it takes about 4 hours for the packets to reach their maximum absorption rate, and they will absorb oxygen until all the iron in them has oxidized. Once all the oxygen is gone, the reaction stops, but it can reactivate once introduced into the air again. An absorber is considered spoiled or ""loaded"" when all the iron in them has oxidized. Complete oxidation of 1 g of iron can remove 300cm 3 of oxygen in standard conditions, which amounts to a volume of air of almost 1,500cm 3 or 1.5L (~50oz) since oxygen only makes up about 20% of the composition of air. If you have a larger container you want to absorb all of the oxygen out of, you could save some money by using a hand warmer in place of several smaller packets in a larger bucket, but the hand warmers aren't exactly food grade , even though I'm sure they won't hurt anything. New oxygen absorbers are good and usable for about a year as long as they are sealed, so it's recommended to only stock up on what you plan on using in a year.

So The asnwer to ""how fast"" is ""about 20 minutes"". This is indeed not a whole lot of time. When it is clear that within the next few minutes the person can not be lowered to the ground by normal means, rescue should start immediately. If the person is conscious, she/he should try to keep some movement of the legs, especially against some resistance, if ground is not avialable. A good thing would be a loop of webbing or rope, which is attached to the rope (e.g. via prussik) so that the person can actively stand in it (and change load between right and left leg). An unconscious person has to be lowered to ground as fast as safely (and sanely) possible. Or, if achievable, pulled up. This is excessively more difficult, but could be the only option (how to pull someone up in such a situation I asked here ) If this is not immediately possible, anything which alleviates the problem at least a little bit is welcome: the height differential between legs and torso is a main problem, so if the body can be brought in a more horizontal position this would help the constriction of the blood flow by the leg loops of the harness is another problem, so if something sturdy like a board is available, shoving it into the leg loops so that the person ""sits"" on it will help. The pressure in the leg tissue is so more evenly distributed which should improve blood flow a bit. After rescued to the ground, DON'T lay the person completely down, keep her/him with the torso upright. The reason is to not to overwhelm the circulation system with a big volume of blood depleted of oxygen and also possibly enriched with buildup of other substances. This can otherwise lead to a situation called ""Bergungstod"" in Germany (death after rescue). The rescuing person should always keep her own safety as top priority",about 20 minutes,0.34428072,127,143,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15872

According to testing done by consumer reports, it is also effective against ticks (despite this being an ""off label"" use). It does not contain DEET, (which can melt certain plastics and rubbers and ruin your $500 hardshell), though it is not quite as effective. As pointed out in the comments, it is poisonous if ingested, so it is important to avoid drinking it. However, it is approved by the EPA as safe and effective when applied to the skin as intended. The main downside of this product is that it can cause some irritation and itching, though it isn't too bad in my case. You can also treat your clothes with Permethrin (also used as a pesticide) to deter insects from biting through them. It kills insects that linger on treated clothing for too long, works for several washings after being applied to clothing and is effective against both flying insects like mosquitos as well as ticks.

23044,,How to coexist with bees/wasps?,"stay away from hives/nests, stay away from food sources","There are a few things that could be contributing to the presence of bees and/or wasps and things that mimic them as they all have different behaviours and different means to get rid of/deter. Note that if you are allergic to bees, you probably aren't allergic to wasps as they are completely unrelated. The answer also depends on where in the world you are. First off - are you able to tell which is which? Bees are fuzzy and typically yellow/black in less obvious stripes with not so brilliant colors, and a not-so-obvious waist. There are only a couple of types of bee (honey and bumble) in most Western urban areas. Bumblebees are large and quite obvious, slow flying, very hairy and (mostly) harmless. Honey bees fly faster and are the typical bee shape and appearance. Wasps tend to have very defined stripes, bright colors a very narrow waist (like an ant, which they are related to) and are largely hairless. Wasps come in a range of different species, with different ""risk"" profiles. The classic yellow and black wasp is could be a hornet or a Vespula species, such as the German , common wasp , or yellow jacket . Other colored wasps could be p aper wasps (tend to have long hanging legs when flying), and a bunch of other species, which are less common or wide-spread. There are also mimics - these are completely harmless and just look like bees/wasps to scare off predators. They are actually a type of hoverfly and will not harm you. They are easiest to tell when not flying - their wings will stick out to the side and the head is a fly head, quite different to a bee. There is a comparison table here , with good images of each and some basic information For all 3 types of insect, it is best just to let them do their thing, if you can not avoid them. Waving arms around does not scare them off, and may provoke defensive behaviour in wasps. Bees and bumblebees are typically harmless unless provoked (i.e. crushed) or you are near their hive. If you are near the hive (less than say 30 m/100 ft) then occasionally you might get chased by a guard bee, but this is relatively rare. A bee might fly by close to you if you are wearing bright colors, particularly shades of blue, or have a sweet scented perfume. They will not typically hang around and search you intensively as they are primarily looking for nectar. Bee hives can be difficult to locate - they are often in hollow trunks of trees or inside walls, rarely outside, if you are seeing a lot of bees, you are probably near the hive or a reliable food source (flowers). Wasps on the other hand are searching for prey and nectar. They have issues with personal space though and will fly around you at close range, even crawling into openings in clothing. Most wasps are carnivorous and will take any insects they can find. They will hover around and search quite extensively from a fairly short range, and occasionally land on you. Do not swat at a wasp - they will sting. They are also attracted to bright colors and sweet scents. Wasp nests are varied according to the type of wasp - they can be underground, in hollow trees, in walls or roof-spaces, under the eaves of buildings, hanging from branches and can be easy to identify if you can see it. I've seen them as small as a golf-ball (paper wasp nest starting out) and heard of them as big as a car (german wasp). If you can identify the nest, this will tell you about the type of wasp and your relative risk. German wasps and hornets tend to be very aggressive, especially in defense of the nest, while paper wasps are less so and will only sting if feeling trapped. There is no one-stop-shop for avoiding all of these different species. The general advice is to stay away from hives/nests, stay away from food sources (and water too - they have to drink also), avoid wearing bright colors, avoid sweet scents and having potential food sources around, avoid sudden movements when they fly by (hard with anxiety, I know). One solution might be to get a small portable tent with a sealable door. Another might be to wear long-sleeved clothing and a hat with a veil. If you are concerned about allergic consequences - consult your doctor or allergist and get tested and carry the appropriate medication for your condition.","stay away from hives/nests, stay away from food sources",0.062605314,3695,3750,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/23044
24594,,How to repair a surfboard leash?,replacing your leash every couple of years,"Miguelmorin's answer is very comprehensive, and if you do want to make a repair, I would definitely recommend following his guidance, however: Your leash can be the difference between life and death or at the very least saves loss of your possibly expensive surfboard so it is not worth the risk of having it go when you need it the most, for example when you really want it to pull you up out of nasty undertow on rocks... The strength of your leash will drop over time, as the materials degrade under UV from the sun; cycles of saltwater and sitting in a humid van or worse, being on the roof in exhaust fumes from traffic; being scraped and scuffed against rocks, coral, other boards etc so if it has snapped once, unless it was from an obvious damaged point, you should consider it likely to snap again. So I personally recommend replacing your leash every couple of years anyway. Singlequiver.com suggests every season if you are a big wave surfer, or 3-4 years if you surf beach waves. They also point out that even if it doesn't snap, as the elasticity goes, it could really yank your ankle painfully. I'm seeing well respected brand leashes at prices around ¬£20 in the UK and similar in the US.

25012,,How to prepare on hiking routes?,maps,"The answers you seek are not easily quantifiable - for instance, a very fit experienced hiker might walk 50+ km a day on flat, open (i.e. not brush covered) terrain, but might only do 5-10 (or less) on steep, thickly forested hills. Some people can walk more than 100 km in a day - on urban streets/race tracks, but would be unlikely to sustain this day-after-day as you might on a long hike like the GR-5. I would guess that for an average hiker (assuming some fitness and a little experience) around 20-30 km per day would be reasonable with a weekend pack (food for 2-4 days, sleeping bag, tent, clothes, water, cooker). I've personally done easily double that on marked trails in New Zealand with experience and good fitness, but also had days off-trail where I've moved less than 1 km/hr. Edited to add: A long long time ago (over 25 years) I was taught that with a weekend pack most people would walk about 4 km/h (2.5 mi/h) on flat terrain and about 300 m (1000') vertical/hour (i.e. to climb from sea-level to 1000 m (3300') altitude on an average hill would take a little over 3 hours). These numbers imply for 8 hours walking about 30 km (18 mi) on the flat or about 8 km (5 mi) climbing (that's a lot - Everest is 8848 m/5.5 mi high) According to GRfive.com , the trail is 2500 km long and takes the average walker about 3.5 months to complete. It covers a lot of different climates, from lowland plains in the Netherlands to alpine passes in the French Alps. I don't know how you would spread out the days, but I suspect that you will have to stop a few times for the weather to be right - don't attempt a high alpine pass in a snow-storm! Being Europe, you most likely will never be particularly far from a village of some sort where you can take shelter if need be. There will be on-line resources and most likely blogs/vlogs which will tell you how people did their attempts. Maps as mentioned in the comment by @TomasBy can be obtained from sporting stores, book shops, online, with GPS subscriptions, libraries etc. I have no experience on the GR5 or anywhere in Europe, but I would expect that starting in the Netherlands (northern part) and working your way south would be easiest. This is so because the Netherlands is flat -gives you time to build fitness, and because it's in the North - colder, wetter, shorter summer. Conversely, the southern part in France is alpine - you don't want snow on the ground as an inexperienced hiker, or any risk of avalanche. You also want a longer window of time for conditions to be right to cross alpine areas - longer summer gives you this. In addition, jumping straight into the alpine parts with no fitness will be very challenging. For training, I would start by walking. Go out 2-3 evenings a week for a walk. Build up to 1-2 hours if you can. On weekends, go for a longer walk. Build this walk up to several hours (take appropriate food, water, clothing). Now start doing it with a pack and some gear (you can substitute anything for weight if you don't want to get gear just yet). Once you can walk comfortably for a few (4-8) hours with weight over any terrain you can access easily; plan an over-night trip - carrying your gear! As for the gear you think you need - ask a specialist hiking/outdoors store, not a generic footballs and basketballs store. At a minimum you will need a hiking boots/shoes, pack, hiking clothes (raincoat, warm clothes, socks etc.), food, water container, compass, maps (and knowledge of how to use!). In addition, as per @Jason comment - you should always have a fairly comprehensive first aid kit and the knowledge on how to use. What else you need depends on where you will stay and how - if camping you need tent, sleeping bag (down is best, warmest, lightest, most compact), sleeping mat, cooker. You should also consider a GPS and emergency beacon. Most hiking gear of any decent quality is incredibly expensive, but buying quality is quite important if you are using it day-after-day - you really don't want to buy a cheap pack because it was half the price of a more expensive one, and then have it fall apart after a month of daily use, or not fit you well because the harness is poorly designed.

You need to have this stuff in your kit: Lanolin : Yes, otherwise known as sheep grease. Sold in pharmacies as an aid for breastfeeding mothers. It is essentially a lubricant wax that will keep a blister happy and not stuck to what you put over it. You put a daub of this directly on the blistered area. Polysporin or that type of thing does not last as well as this stuff. Lambs wool : Take a bit of this and cover over the lanolin. Regular cotton balls do not cut it. Athletic Tape : Use large strips of tape to cover over the blistered area and enough on each side to keep the tape attached. Make quite a few layers. You'll know it's enough when you put your boot back on and walking no longer hurts. You can do this and leave it on until the end of your trip.

One thing to note, the inside of the rope might have been strained and this isn't easily visible from the outside - sometimes you can feel the outer layer sliding over these areas. Rope has a shelf-life - but this also depends on how often you use it. Another rule of thumb to follow is that if you have taking one major outdoor lead fall on the rope (from above protection), then you retire it. You can take several minor falls before retiring it. Top-rope falls should almost have negligible effect - unless there was a lot of slack in the system for some reason and the climber fell more than a couple of metres or so.

The map shown in the question indicates what a number of features look like.

Imagine one big hour-hand on a clock, which is centered on the north star (to which the two pointer stars ""point."" Read the time to the nearest quarter hour as if it were a normal clock. Add one hour for every month after March 7. Do this to the nearest quarter month. The star clock will read 12:00 at midnight on March 7, so memorize March 7, no matter where you are. If today is April 9, then it is about 1 month after March 7, so add 1 hour. Double the time (because it is really a 24-hour clock). Subtract from 24 (or 48 if necessary). We subtract because the clock is going backwards, that is, counterclockwise. Correct for Zone Time, because you've already memorized that when the sun says noon that we call it (for example) 1:30 during daylight savings. The website also gives an example, so you can work trough it too make sure you understand all the steps. You do need to remember of few things, but once you get the hang of it should be pretty straightforward. I looked online and apparently for the southern hemisphere there is a similar method using the Southern Cross.",to use well known stars,0.072924919,32,55,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1093
1144,,How do I get started duck hunting?,buy a gun,"I started with a buddy of mine. So he had most of the gear that was needed. I just needed to buy a gun, do hunter safety, waders and some camo. Now if you're not in a situation where you have someone who already hunts you might need to do a fair amount of local research. The basics you will need are what I had to buy a gun, waders, and some camo. With the waders you will not need a dog right out of the gate. My buddy and I still don't even use a dog. The next big problem is where to hunt. This you will have to figure out locally. Where I live we go to public land that requires that you have a boat to get to a good spot. If you have private land you can scout it out for where you see ducks and then you could setup there. You also might be able to find public land that you could park your car and walk to. With decoys we started with buying a 12 pack of whatever ducks you have locally. Early season we tend to use less decoys because the duck travel in smaller groups and then increase as the season goes on. So later we bought another 12 pack of mallards which are the late season bird here. The best resource I found while starting is the Ducks Unlimited website. They have a good amount of resources on decoys, calls, guns, and just about anything you will need.",buy a gun,0.035141539,93,102,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1144

Here's my best suggestions from my experience: If at all possible stop hiking for a week (I know the scenario you set up precludes this ). Assuming for the rest of these you have to keep going: Whenever you stop, lie down with your feet up. If a cold stream is nearby, sticking your legs in it would be preferable. Take NSAIDs (Ibuprofen would be the my preference). My personal, probably body-destroying dosage is to take a lot. I'm ~200lbs, so if it gets bad I'm taking 4x200mg tabs at a time, every 4 hours. I've gotten by on 2x200mg but it was painful. Wear compression on your shins. The best thing I've gotten was a neoprene calf sleeve, but I've also done it successfully with just a normal ACE bandage. Anything that provides compression on your shin really, I once doubled up a stretchy ankle brace and used that. If you are far enough out that you have to camp with shinsplints, sleep with your feet and knees raised (put a log under your tent, or use your backpack under your knees). With just the Ibuprofen and compression, I was able to hike 10-12 hours a day, 30+km for 5 days, and only truly suffered for the first 2 days, it started healing almost immediately once compression was added.

Rain Jacket If you have a bad year, you can have 80+ days of rain, and the shoulder straps of your backpack will wear out (delaminate usually) the shoulders of your rain jacket. Shoes are covered over in the other question pretty thoroughly I'd say. Pants : If you wear pants, chances are you'll go through a couple pairs. Usually the ankles are the part that goes, followed by the knees/groin. Socks : Depending on what type you go with, you'll go through quite a few pairs. If you think of durability when choosing socks, it could be a wise choice. Darn Tough socks are a staple for AT hikers. Beyond that, I'll just say that a lot of your gear will be heavily worn by the AT. Putting 150 nights on all your gear is more than a lifetime for most hikers. I would say you'll end up retiring at least some of these: all your daily worn clothes, tent, backpack, all waterproof stuff sacks (will no longer be waterproof), sleeping bag, insulated jacket, and rain pants. I've heard from various thru-hikers, and it's a pretty wide range that people experience. I know some people that have their triple crown who used essentially the same set of gear the whole way and others who changed everything after each trail.

1284,,How are sleeping bag temperature ratings determined?,each manufacturer decides for itself,"Sadly, in North America, there is no rating beyond what each manufacturer decides for itself. I suspect that in the US especially, some thought goes into liability (i.e. if someone freezes to death in a bag that's rated to 0F and it's 20F out, they could be in trouble). Certain manufacturers gain a reputation for conservative ratings, others for optimistic ratings... and sadly, some manufacturers are all over the map (i.e. don't use an internally consistent rating system at all). Fortunately, there is a standard that is (hopefully) coming to North America, called EN 13537 . It is currently applied to all bags in the EU and certain manufacturers elsewhere. The standard establishes a way to test sleeping bags, and then provides each bag with a set of ratings from an lower ""you won't die"" limit, all the way up to ""you will be sweaty"" upper limit. There's another wrinkle though, which is that a lot of the warmth people attribute to their ""awesome"" sleeping bag, comes from a combination of other factors: sleeping pad R-value, sleeping clothing, tent heat retention, site selection, and what I'll call metabolism (i.e. whether you are a ""cold"" or ""hot"" sleeper). So when you ask whether a 15F bag is really good to 15F, I'd say that it's impossible to know without getting the bag and trying it, at least in North America. I think if you know you have controlled all the other variables, and are a ""hot"" sleeper, with research you can likely find out which manufacturers are conservative raters, and go with them. In Europe, you'd just need to know where you fit in their spectrum of ratings and buy similar bags to that in a different temperature range (much easier!). An example that might help explain what I'm talking about: Montbell U.L. SUPER SPIRAL DOWN HUGGER #1 is EN rated as 26F ""Comfort"", 15F ""Lower Limit"", -19F ""Extreme"".

Make sure you do not overdo it and end up not being able to find it back yourself. :-) Although you are in the wood, if you are in a popular area, it is possible that other local visit the same area. I've never heard of people bringing alarms for their bags and don't recommend it. I doubt it will be of any help if somebody decides to steal an abandoned backpack. It is also a possible unpleasant noise that does not belong in the wild . Please no car alarms backpackers :-). Personally, I use a small wallet pouch or water proof bag that I carry at all times. In it you will find one personal identification card, one credit card or bank card and a single bill in case of emergency. Sometimes I will also have a single key (car or home). I also carry a small emergency kit on me in case an accident happens. This has actually been proven useful once after our team separated ourselves from our bags/equipement for a side trail. One person had a head injury (a bump on the head in the small hundred rupee monk house that led to a fair amount of bleeding; lets just say that the blessing was short lived!). Having the emergency kit on me instead of my backpack helped a lot. When you separate yourself from your bag, it is important to have something in case you don't find back your bag or cannot get back to your bag. You can usually anchor your wallet pouch to your pants to prevent accidentally dropping it.

If possible try and do both inside and out. If you want to do a permanent repair there seem to be two options: Repair in a similar way to fiberglass . I.e. Sand the surrounding area and apply a fiberglass patch and epoxy. The one significant difference is that the area around the hole should be flame treated before applying the patch by lightly heating with a propane torch or similar. This helps the epoxy bond to the surface. Be careful not to burn your boat though. The alternative, more conventional, way is to melt/weld more plastic into the hole . I suspect this is what a professional would do if you asked them to do the repair. Here's another good article on it. For smallish holes you want to get some polyethylene welding rod (presuming the boat is polyethylene) for large holes you need to get a patch.

If you are in Northern Hemisphere: First locate the Polaris . Its the last star in The Ursa Minor . I've had trouble in locating it sometimes. Many people do. So, if you are in such a situation, try locating The Ursa Major . The Ursa Major is located just to the north of The Celestial Pole . Depending upon the time of the year constellation of stars may be tipped in different directions as it rotates around the Polaris, so you could use the two stars that form the outer edge of the Ursa Major. Join the two starts from the Ursa Major to the one last star in Ursa Minor. The star that you have pointed to is Polaris. Draw an imaginary straight line from Polaris to the ground, thats the North! More popularly, the Ursa Minor is also known as The Little Dipper and the Ursa Major is known as The Big Dipper. If you are in Southern Hemisphere: In southern hemisphere, The North Star, Polaris is not visible, so You'll need to identify the Southern Cross , also known as Crux . The Southern Cross is constellation that has 5 starts, the 4 of them being brighter than the other and angled together and quite far away from the 5th star, Acrux aka Alpha Crusis . Draw an imaginary line towards the ground from the axis that intersects Acrux. That is the south, so the north will be exactly opposite to it and behind you. Now as suggested in the Sydney Observatory link, depending upon how deeper south you are, you will find the Crux tipping on nearly every hour. Then how do you locate the north direction? If you can observe that the Crux rotates around/about an imaginary point. The point shall help you in finding South and North direction. If you are at Equator: If you are around Equator, I bet you can easily spot The Orion Constellation . Its one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky. It is visible from both hemispheres depending on the time of the year. It is a permanent feature on the equator. Spot the 3 starts forming a line, very prominent trio of starts, often called as The Orion's Belt . The Orion's Belt rises from East to West. So now you know your North. Using Cassiopeia Constellation: You can locate Cassiopeia exactly opposite to the Ursa Major. In this spider-legged 'M' shaped constellation, draw a line between 3rd and 4th star (Counting from Left to Right, or to be precise considering with 3 stars at the bottom and the remaining 2 at the top like an M), then draw a perpendicular to that line, the perpendicular points to Polaris.

This means the callouse can be pulled off, called a flapper : To maintain your skin you want to sand down any callouses that get too thick ( see this question ) The idea of moisturising is that it keeps the skin elastic and prevents it becoming too tough, i.e. start forming callouses.

7751,,How to straighten a bent tent pole,pipe or tube straightener,"Aluminum has a crystal structure and can be hardened using a process called ""work hardening."" Long story short, you've hardened your pole by causing dislocation movements in the crystal structure of the aluminum. If you compare your bent pole to your other poles, you'll notice that it doesn't flex as much as it used to, that is because it is now a harder alloy than the rest. Any attempt to bend it back now that you've somewhat work-hardened it will cause fractures in the alloy. The only way to soften the aluminum is to anneal it, which involves heating the aluminum almost to it's melting point and then letting it cool slowly, but if you try to do that then your pole will be so soft that it won't flex, it'll just bend like welding wire. You would have to know how to re-harden the aluminum after you annealed it and bent it back, not a simple process, and not that cheap to get a metal worker to do it for you. You're best option is to either replace your pole, or deal with it being bent, unless you have a friend who is a millwright and knows how to anneal and harden alloys. Bent poles aren't that bad, I've been using bent poles in my MSR Hubba Hubba for years. Your pole is still strong, it's just not as straight and flexible as it used to be, annoying, but still functional. You won't be able to get your pole back to what it was, but if you wanted to attempt to get your pole straight and see how much longer it lasts, my recommendation would be to use a pipe or tube straightener . Just don't expect results, and expect a struggle, like I said, that hardened bend won't bend back easy, if you take the pole to a hardware store then you might find some plumber guy that'll be convinced he could get it straight for you.

7840,,How would I find a hot spring?,hunters and trappers,"It helps to know what is going on underground when looking for geological patters. Hot springs are of course geothermally heated by pockets of magma in the crust that are relatively close to the surface. Understanding the underlaying strata and ground water patters are essential to accurately predicting where hydraulic phenomena will appear. At the very least you need a stratigraphic map so you can examine fault structures and determine where layers of porous rock intersect with faults, the surface, and also where aquatards may inhibit ground water flow. As others have already indicated here, the fact that the hot springs you are observing are in a line suggests that they are over a fault line, likely an area of tectonic uplift. If you were to examine the stratigraphy of the areas where the known hot springs are, you could identify which layers of strata the heated groundwater is permeating to the surface from, and then locate other areas along that line where those same layers intersect with the surface again. I'll confess that reading a stratiographic map isn't that easy, but if you can even get a vague idea of where you might suspect undiscovered springs will appear based on the geology and geography, it will greatly reduce your search area. Without conducting a geological survey with a team of geologists, the next best thing to do is to go bush whackin' away from the beaten trail, using the suggestions that @Sherwood gave you in their answer. An IR thermal imager would be handy to bring along with you, you can get relatively affordable ones that attach to your iPhone . It's no simple task to actually go out and find natural resources. Which is the number one reason why geologists are able to get jobs other than just teaching... Most of the time when people stumble onto hot-springs it's because they're looking for something else. Lots of springs are discovered by hunters and trappers this way. Good luck finding your personal secret hotspring, I'm sure you'll have fun exploring the untamed bush whether you find one or not.

7850,,How to humanely kill an injured bird?,put the bird in a carrier bag and hit it hard against a wall,"In the UK you should probably contact the RSPCA or RSPB . I think RSCPA is probably best as they actually do welfare stuff whereas RSPB is about conservation. They should have the best knowledge of whether the bird needs to be killed and how best to do it. I presume other countries have similar charities. If you need to kill the bird yourself I think the best way, without specialist equipment, is to wring its neck. If you do it properly it should kill the bird pretty much instantly. However, you need to make sure to commit fully and not do a half assed job that will cause it more suffering. This is mainly an issue if you are a bit squeamish about it. Another option which I've heard is reasonably humane is to put the bird in a carrier bag and hit it hard against a wall. This seems horrible to me, but may be easier to actually do than to wring its neck Here is a guide for how to kill a chicken by wringing its neck. The principles should be the same for other birds too. The basic process is as follows: Hold the bird by the legs (or possibly around the body for small birds) in our weaker hand. Place the back of the birds head in the crook between you thumb and fingers and hold firmly. Pull the neck sharply downwards, bringing the neck backwards at the same time by twisting your hand and to push your knuckles into the bird's back. The bird may still flap a lot for some time when dead. However, providing you broke its neck it will not be in any pain. Another suggested method is to place the birds neck under a broom handle or similar.

8209,,How to walk silently in the woods?,Soft cotton or wool,"When I was a boy I learned about a tribe of natives (Lipan Apache) that had an initiation into manhood which involved plucking a hair from the tail of a live deer. These people had developed a mode of stealth that allowed them to walk right up to deer‚Äìhead on‚Äìwithout the deer sensing their presence or noticing their advance. I adopted the technique for moving through the woods silently, but never to the point where I could stealthily touch a deer. I'll skip the masking your scent and disguising your appearance parts and just give you the silent walking part. First of all, you must have good balance, so take a semi-squat stance to lower you body weight. With each step, you will balance on one foot, while you test the ground ahead of you with the smallest toe of your other foot. You want to plant your foot where it isn't going to make any noise, first touch the ground with your small toe, using it to part the grass or move leaves, then gently rock onto your lateral arch down to your heel as you shift your weight onto your forward foot and flatten it out onto the ground, the last part of your foot to touch the ground is your big toe. Complete the step by transferring all your weight to your forward foot, then feel ahead with the other. The deer touchers did this very slow, averaging about 80 seconds per step, in a breeze they could rock with the grass and branches and go about 60 seconds a step. The super slow speeds were so the deer wouldn't register them moving, even if they were staring straight in their direction. When nothing's watching you you can move quickly through the woods stepping this way, just touch with your small toe first and ease into each step, when you get good you tend to glide more than you stride. The part to practice is making contact with the ground without making a crunch, it's easy to do on a path, but harder to do when moving through the bush. As far as what clothes and shoes to wear: the deer touchers went barefoot and wore nothing but a loincloth and ash from a fire, but any soft soled shoe will work for foot wear, toeshoes would be the best. For clothing you don't want to wear anything synthetic, nylon and polyester make that whishing sound when you walk.

You can also cook meats on a heated rock, which is a technique still used in restaurants today for steak cooking. This should be easy enough if you have prepared a fire ring. A flat clean rock is best, and you can take the rock out of the fire to prevent spitting or over cooking.

9154,,How do I setup a proper jig?,tie the jig directly to the leader,"I assume you are asking about striped bass . Although I have never fished for stripers (or rockfish, depending on where you are) on the Pacific side of the USA, this is the species that surf anglers in the Northeast target most passionately. Many of the best places to find them are those with strong currents and places to hide in ambush. These conditions often require fairly heavy lures, and the bucktail jig rigged with pork rind is typically what anglers use to get down to where the fish are. The weight you need will depend on the depth of the water and strength of the current - and you'll have to play around a bit (and probably lose a few to snags) to figure out exactly what you need. But you want enough weight so that a steady slow retrieve keeps the bucktail 1.5 - 2 feet above the bottom A good way to start would be to use a 2 oz. bucktail with a 6"" or so pork rind. I favor red/white, but local anglers would know what works best. Cast the lure and let it sink until it hits bottom (you may get a strike on the descent.) Start cranking steady and relatively slowly - imagine a non startled fish swimming along lazily. After you have the lure moving well, stop cranking and count how long it takes to hit the bottom again. You want it to be 2-3 seconds or so. If it takes longer, it is running too high and you need more weight. Less time and it's too high and you need less weight. This is the bare bones basics, but it should get you started. John Skinner is a local author and accomplished angler. His videos are worth watching - and his books worth buying. Here's on on fishing bucktails On the south shore of Long Island we also use small diamond jigs with rubber tube tails . This might be more in line with what you are thinking, but we really only use these when the bass are focusing on sand-eels in the surf. And we use small ones - too small to be of much use in deep fast moving water. With both of these lures, the most common way to rig them is to tie a 5-6' length of 20 - 40 lb test fluorocarbon leader to your main line. And then tie the jig directly to the leader.

9402,,How do I achieve/maintain optimal hydration?,paying attention to your thirst,"The absolute best way to figure out when to drink is by paying attention to your thirst. If you drink a cup of water when you aren't really thirsty, your body will start getting rid of excess fluid within a few minutes. But if you drink that same cup when you are seriously dehydrated, you won't pee it out because your body won't have excessive moisture. This is all related to how much fluid is in your body, not the time since your last urination. If you want to avoid peeing any more than you have to, get very, very familiar with how you feel when you are just slightly dehydrated (a tiny bit thirsty, but not excessively so, and certainly not unpleasantly so). Then drink small amounts frequently when you start feeling that way. Have a couple of swallows: that will momentarily slake your thirst. Then if you are thirsty again in 5 minutes, repeat this. If you drink large amounts, you are more likely to drink enough to completely rehydrate completely, and need to pee again. It will take experimentation to figure out exactly how much you need to drink, and what you should feel like, but once you do, it's quite reliable. If you are trying this, and don't drink enough, you can get seriously dehydrated, especially if you are sweating a lot. So be cautious when you are starting out, and err on the side of drinking more.

9745,,"How to ""spot"" someone who is bouldering?",making sure that they safely land on the pad with their feet first,"Basically, ""spotting"" someone means making sure that they safely land on the pad with their feet first to prevent injuries in case of a fall. This means several distinct tasks: Moving a falling climber to the pad: try to guide them towards the pad, ideally by pushing at the hips or shoulders. Don't try to catch them (which includes not standing directly beneath them)! You won't be able to do that, and might hurt yourself. However, you can try to slow the fall a bit. While doing that, keep your fingers together, and your thumb next to the index finger (not opposed). Keeping them upright: Especially in very overhanging routes, prefer to keep your hands under their shoulders so that they land on their feet. Landing on your back really hurts, but is easily prevented that way. Prevent them from falling over while landing: make sure that they don't tumble backwards and off the pad. That can still hurt quite a bit, especially after long falls! Moving the pad (not applicable in most indoor gyms): if necessary, adjust the position of the pad if the climber moves to a position where they would not hit it when falling. This is easier with multiple spotters; otherwise, you should only do that when the climber is in a somewhat safe position. Smaller pushes with your feet are preferable to picking up the pad with your hands. As in many other climbing situations, communication is key; e.g. most of the climbers that I know really appreciate it if you tell them before you move the pad (so they can take a safe position), or assure them that you are really paying attention while they are at a hard move.",making sure that they safely land on the pad with their feet first,0.220614463,36,102,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9745

9999,,How to react to an aggressive boar,stand tall and shout at (it,"Possible threats First of all we should consider what threats may apply: Potential Threats to Hikers from Wild Pigs wild boar with sharp tusks Feral pigs can exhibit aggressive territorial behaviors. Hogs may weigh up to 300 pounds or more, can charge at least 11 mph and can quickly attack hikers. Boars have four extremely sharp tusks up to five inches long that can severely injure or kill a hiker. Hikers can contract disease (undulant fever, etc) from any contact with an infected hog. Pigs can contaminate water sources with their feces. I think it's especially interesting that a boar can harm you more than just with its direct physical charges. How an attack looks like Friends of the boar have summarized how an encounter might look like from the beginning. I want to show of the warn signs which should ring your bells to prevent an actual charge. (If you see a group of boars,) at least one of the boars will become more active now, usually a juvenile, and will walk towards you, maybe a little nervous, sometimes turning round to return to the others. The move towards you is for a better look, for they have very poor eyesight. Others may soon join in. It may take just a few seconds for this to happen. Now, this is not aggression. They are not ganging up on you, but are being brave and facing their potential threat. They are like children now, excited and about to be proud of warning mum that they have spotted you. Mum may now join in, sniffing you and deciding whether to walk or run away. If she decides to run, she will belt out a loud grunt or snort, and turn tail. At this moment, all the younger boar will also flee at high speed away from you. It's all rush and noise, and you hear feet stampeding away. That's usually it. Mum may stop shortly afterwards and take another look at you, maybe even walk back towards you. Again, this is not aggression. She is saying to you, ""You saw how fast we are so don't bother following."" She will either stay and start feeding again, or if you move towards her in the hope of a photo, she will grunt again and run. How does a boar behave if push comes to shove? Friends of the boar and Wikipedia : Even in these terrible circumstances for the boar, the boar attack is very fast and is not a charge made from many meters away. The boar are close to the aggressor, maybe just a second or two away. Actual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in multiple penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars' rutting season from November‚ÄìJanuary, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated. Also be aware that there might be a different ""charge style"": A female bites you. Her head doesn't lower. Instead, look for her shackles on the shoulders to rise and maybe her tail stand erect. She will also growl. How to react A boar doesn't charge instantly. It gives you warnings (a lot of them actually - see the previous section). I know, the question is more about the point where it's already too late, but it's worth to mention how you can prevent a charge in the first place. (If a) boar may walk straight at you (...), stand tall and shout at (it). Move towards (it) confidently but not aggressively, and (it) will probably move out of your way. If (it) follows you don't panic but keep walking away - (it) will soon get fed up. Just be confident, if (it) is tame she will not hurt you. Nearly the same thing applies to react to a the described ""bite attack"". If ever you see these signs, move away confidently, reassuring her with soft words rather than screams or shouts. You may sometimes hear a growl from scrub where she is hiding with her piglets. If you ever hear growling in the scrub, don't wait to see her, go back immediately from where you came. You should take these actions to defend yourself: How to Survive if Threatened: If you ever have a faceoff with a hostile pig your best option to defend yourself may be to climb the nearest tree, boulder, car, etc. You want to get at least 6 feet off of the ground because large pigs can somewhat ""walk"" up a tree trunk with their front legs. If a pig charges and you can't escape you can try to sidestep very quickly to avoid the potential swing of its tusks. Your last resort may be to physically fight back with whatever means possible until the mauling ends. While fighting back try to remain standing.

10196,,How to react to someone measuring distances?,take them aside,"This answer is not exclusive to archery but concerns basically any activity where there are certain implicit rules that are widely agreed on in the community and are written down explicitly for competitions. Since you say that it was during a tournament and covered by the rules, then it's easy. You can refer to the rules which should also state what is the penalty in such a case. If it seems to be someone who is new to the sport, it might be fair to tell them that measuring distances is not allowed by the rules and if they should repeat that behaviour ‚Äì now that they know about it ‚Äì you would have to raise this violation to the tournament organizers, referees or whatever entity is taking care of the rules. In a context where there are no written rules, there can't be a rule violation, only things that ""you don't do as a ( insert performer of random activity here )"". So, if the behaviour in question occurs in a random occasion it depends on how much this influences your own performance and how well-meaning you are towards that person. If their behaviour doesn't directly influence you and you don't really care about that person and their reputation, you could just let it go. If there are no written rules, there is no real cheating, only bad style. If you don't care about the style and reputation of this other person, ignore it and make a note to yourself that you don't take their results too serious. In the case that you either care about that person's reputation and/or it influences your own performance (you get distracted by their laser spot on a target, by seeing them point with a strangely looking device at something or whatever), then take them aside and inform them that the way they are doing this is not the way it is normally thought to be done and that it disturbs the people around them and/or might be bad for their reputation.",take them aside,0.016705941,1666,1681,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10196
10200,,How to start foraging in the UK?,really easy,"Foraging is actually really easy in the UK, there are plenty of easy start plants and berries you can look for. Do you require anything specific to start doing this? Realistically, no not at all, as some plants you can forage in your own back garden. However, it's a good idea to get yourself a decent reference book - we brought the Collins pocket guide called 'Food For Free', which has plenty of information in... but with the internet and good signal you can reference a lot of plants on your phone. The biggest requirement is usually land-owners permission, you don't want to go scrumping ( To steal fruit from another persons property) on someone's property if you do not have their OK to do so - but often fruit goes to waste so it might be easier to get permission than you think. Regardless of permission, we still call it scrumping! Equipment wise, a basket or bag and a pair of gloves should do. What is the best way to start learning how to forage in the UK? Simply put: Nettles, Dandelions, Blackberries, Elderflower These are the most easily recognisable plants in the UK - you might need gloves to get the blackberries and nettles - but you can also make some decent dishes with these ingredients too. Nettles leaves can be blanched and eaten, or used in a soup. Dandelions can also be cleaned and blanched, they're a pretty good filler in a salad, tasting akin to rocket leaves (sharp, with a bit of a peppery taste) however it can be bitter if picked at the wrong time of year, the younger the plant the better. The dandelion root can also be cleaned, baked and crumbled into a sort of coffee/tea - I have tried this but, honestly, it's an acquired taste. It's used in 'detoxes' but also it was used during both World Wars as a tea substitute. Everyone loves a Blackberry! Easy to recognise and doesn't take much imagination to come up with something to eat them with... like ice cream... The only real factor here is to try and find some off the main roads, so they're not covered in pollutants from vehicles. And wash them carefully, checking for bugs - you're not the only person to like them! Elderflower flowers make a great wine / champagne, if you've the time to make them, but you can also fry them in flour to make elderflower fritters. The berries are also edible, making this plant a good forage twice in the same year! The idea here is to get familiar with a FEW plants and regularly take an interest in them, even if you're not foraging. We grew from the above list into a multitude of interesting plants we can recognise, and pick, on our regular walks. One such being Sloes . If you're not comfortable picking it, don't pick it, but take a photo and research it. AVOID : Mushrooms, if you're going to pick them to reference later, handle them little and don't eat them - it's best to get a guide for these if you really want to pick them to eat.",really easy,0.026830571,21,32,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10200

These are sensitive areas, and a shark that has mistaken you for a seal, or is just investigating, will usually be frightened away. Reading reviews of people who have been attacked (and survived), almost all people do exactly this - although I think is instinctual rather than learned behavior. I have serious doubts that anyone being attacked by a shark stops to think ""What was it I read on the internet..."" before reacting. Once (if) the shark backs off, you have to consider what the next thing to do it. Swimming for it at full speed won't really help - you will never our run a shark, In Fanning's case, he had swam to the jet ski and was able to get up out of the water, then taken out of the area, very quickly.

Although the pain of dental infection can be extreme, the more critical issues are related to the spread of infection . Patients with more serious infections will show facial swelling and fever. In the field, temporary pain relief can be obtained with topical pain relievers like Orabase or oil of cloves, and with oral or injectable pain medication. If immediate evacuation is not possible, high dose antibiotics and warm compresses should be initiated. In extreme circumstances, the tooth can be pulled, and it should be remembered that until quite recently in dental history pulling the tooth was the definitive treatment. Regarding your specific questions: I wonder if it's even a good idea to remove the tooth?! As stated above, it can be, although I would advise that it can sometimes be difficult to know exactly which tooth is infected and it's entirely possible you'll pull the wrong one out.

It is very unlikely you will be able to tell a barely used human made trail from a game trail. Hikers like to be very obvious about the trails they make, and established trails are well worn. If a trail is very narrow, has undisturbed or barely disturbed ground cover, and is a bit overgrown, it's likely to be a game trail. Look at the ground cover. If it looks identical to the surrounding ground, it's more likely a game trail. Look for upturned or heavily compressed leaves (relative to the surrounding ground cover) and footprints. These are signs of human use, although the leaf disturbances might also come from animal use. Animals will use human made trails, so hoofprints don't tell you much either way. If you are somewhere without leaves, just compare the ground surface to the surrounding area. The bigger the differences, the more likely it is to be a human trail. Look at the vegetation up top. If you see broken branches, especially from waist to eye height, it might be human activity. If you don't see broken branches, but there are none to snag your clothes or poke you in the eye, it usually means a person removed them. Look for litter. This is a sure sign of human use. Keep in mind that the trail might just lead to a party spot for locals. Additionally, game trails that do look like human trails usually revert to typical game trails in a hundred feet or so at most.

This particular urban legend is more often brought up in the context of defense against people, but it seems now to have been extended to bears. I would stick with the bear spray . In the US, the phrase ‚ÄúIt is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling‚Äù will be found on pesticide containers. This is a hint that this may be a bad idea. Wasp spray usually contains poisons rather than irritants, which creates additional legal problems if you use it on people or bears. Regarding the claims around range, a can of UDAP bear spray has a range of 30-35‚Äô (9-11 meters). Wasp sprays tend to be effective out to 15-22‚Äô (6-7 meters). This oversight may be due to the origin of the myth in an anti-human context: keychain style pepper sprays have a shorter range, although even the anti-human sprays are available in longer-range versions. Regarding precision, bear spray presents in a conical cloud. Beyond close range that cloud will be about 100‚Äù (2.5 meters) in diameter. In contrast, wasp spray presents as a narrow stream, the better to soak a small nest rather than contaminate a larger area. This is a negative for the wasp spray, for the same reason that firearms are considered less effective than bear spray: most people‚Äôs ability to effectively aim goes away when under extreme stress. Edit to add: The neurotoxins in wasp spray (usually pyrethins) have a far greater impact on insects compared to mammals. This comes from differences in body size, absorption, capacity to metabolize, and sodium channel sensitivity. For example, in cases where people have been sprayed, no incapaciting effects were seen . To summarize, the claims of the proponents appear to be incorrect regarding range, misapplied regarding accuracy, and baseless regarding actual efficacy.

14963,,How do you make a stone axe?,knapping,"There are two principal techniques for making stone tools, depending on the properties of the material you have available. The first and probably best known is knapping . This is used with glassy rocks like flint and obsidian which can form sharp fracture surfaces when struck or pressed. This process takes a fair degree of skill as you need to understand how the stone will fracture and is a very different technique to conventional stone carving. Flint tools can perform surprisingly well, in particular they can take an extremely sharp edge, in some cases sharper than can be achieved with steel. The downside is that the material is quite brittle and the edge dulls fairly quickly when used for chopping. The second method is to shape stone by abrasion as in this example using a second stone as a grinding surface, possibly aided with a sand and water mixture. As an aside it is also interesting to note that a lot of early cast metal axes (ie copper and bronze) look very similar to this type of stone axe. Having said that in a survival situation making a stone axe is likely to be a very low priority. Building shelter etc only requires thin poles which can usually be cut with even quite a small knife with relatively little effort and standing wood does not usually make good fuel, you are much better off collecting dead wood which should by dry enough to snap easily. Equally the techniques required are somewhat specialist and labour intensive and so unless you have prior experience there is a good chance that making them will require more effort than is saved. In terms of binding a common material is rawhide or processed sinew which is applied wet and shrinks as it dries, tightening the bindings. For obvious reasons fixing a stone head to a haft is a bit more tricky than a steel one and it is far from easy to achieve a connection strong enough to withstand the rigours of chopping and you also have to consider the potential danger if the head does come off during use. With all this in mind, in a survival situation just using the head as a hand axe is potentially more practical.",knapping,0.357809335,160,168,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14963
15186,,How to process iron in the wilderness?,bloomery furnace,"The simplest way of smelting iron is a bloomery furnace . This is essentially a beehive shaped structure, covered in clay and containing alternating layers of charcoal and iron ore with openings top and bottom to allow a controlled airflow through the stack. Iron ore comes in several forms but is essentially various iron oxides mixed with silicates. The chemistry behind a bloomery furnace is that the burning charcoal creates both a high temperature and a carbon rich atmosphere inside the furnace in which oxygen is taken away from the iron to react with the carbon (reduction). At the end of the burn the furnace is taken apart and if the process is successful there should be a porous mass of metallic iron mixed with silicate slag, called a 'bloom'. Depending on the quality of the ore and the exact conditions in the furnace there may also be a certain amount of steel of varying carbon content. This bloom must them be re heated in a forge and repeatedly hammered and folded to create a usable material. The end product of this 'fining' process is wrought iorn, a composite of more or less pure metallic iron interspersed with fine fibres of silicates. This can either be used as it is with similar properties to mild steel or further processed by carburisation to make steel. A development of this process involves a rather more sophisticated furnace fed with forced air which both reduces the ore and diffuses carbon into the metal, creating cast iron which has a significant carbon content (around 3-5%) and consequently a low enough melting point (around 1200C) to be cast. Usually the raw 'pig iron' from a furnace needs to be remelted to produce a usable pure material. Producing good quality steel requires additional steps as you need to precisely control the carbon content of the resulting alloy.",bloomery furnace,0.091267936,39,55,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15186

15324,,How can I acquire practical outdoor skills?,take longer trips,"Start with making a better list of skills to learn. Identifying edible foods is nowhere near skill #1. I occasionally pick berries, and even more rarely catch and eat a fish, but you can have decades of wilderness fun without ever eating wild food. So, step 1, read some trip reports, books about long trips that relate to your planned excursions. For example if you want to canoe camp, read about a long and epic canoe trip somewhere near your target area (the Amazon is very different from Northern Ontario.) If you want to hike, read about a through-hike. If you want to climb mountains, read about mountain climbing (but don't read about Everest if you want to do something around Tuscany.) From these you will develop your actual skill list. Step 2, do some of this in a supported way. Ideally, get someone to take you on a short trip where you can practice things and get help if you're not doing them correctly. If that's not possible, practice when you're not on a trip: put the tent up inside, cook on your camp stove on your apartment balcony, try packing into your backpack and walking around the block with it for an hour. Here if you can't do something properly there's no harm done, you just return to your safe warm house and your fridge full of food. Make a packing list, and then for a few days try using only things that are on the packing list. When you reach for something you hadn't listed, you can add it to the list. Step 3, do some of it for real, but still somewhat supported. For example, when you canoe in Algonquin Park, the portages are all marked with large signs. You can generally find them by just observing where the 5 or 6 other canoes on the lake are headed. This means your map skills don't have to be amazingly great yet, you just basically need to know north from south. Also the campsites are marked (and on maps you can buy) and fire rings are already built. This means ""Choosing a safe place to camp"" reduces to ""evaluate if you would like this camp site or want to keep going to another one."" This should be a trip with at least one other person, even if they too are a complete beginner. Solo camping requires you to carry much more weight and requires more skill. Through it all, keep reading - ""how to camp"" books if you like, or just inspirational stories. Do small practice trips. Three days without shaving or brushing your teeth won't kill you, and next time your packing list will be a little more complete. You will learn how to get your tent up quickly, and what time you have to start making dinner so you're not eating in the dark. You'll spend the night somewhere buggy or noisy or otherwise non ideal, and next time you'll choose a better campsite. You'll see some wildlife but do something that spooks it, and next time you'll do better. As you get more skilled, you can take longer trips. And at some point you'll realize you're getting good at this.",take longer trips,0.265998125,2829,2846,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15324

16278,,How unsafe is this belay technique really?,It's not unsafe,"It's not unsafe; really. Gyms will enforce the most foolproof techniques they can, because they can't afford to have some idiot hurt themselves in their gym. Gyms see a lot of casual climbers, and fresh beginners, and they don't want them picking up any habits that could lead to complacency. Sure, the brake-under-slide (or PBUS) is the most redundant and reliable belay, but when you're standing on the 6th pitch of a rotten dolomite face trying to pull 70m of rope while dealing with rope drag so bad you can't tell if you're only taking up the slack or up-hauling your second, then you really don't care about your handwork. Having slack in the rope is way more unsafe than how you're pulling it through your belay device; sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, and just because there is a preferred, safer method, doesn't mean that all other methods are dangerous. The most dangerous aspect of rock climbing is the human condition. A competent climber could belay you without any device at all. They used to train newbie climbers by tying an 80lb sand bag to the end of a hemp rope, handing the other end of the rope to a belayer, and dropping the weight over the branch of a big tree or over a beam. If the belayer could stop the weight using a hip belay, then he was considered good enough to climb with all the big boys (it was sort of an initiation, because no matter how good you were at it, it still hurt each time you did it).

16735,,How to avoid dangerous encounters with hippopotamuses?,stay a respectable distance away,"The most common mistakes made by people in hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius , territory in Africa include: As with every other animal, the most important mistake is not taking the time to learn about their behavior and respect it Getting between parents and calves Getting between males when they're fighting for territory Getting in their way when they're attacking their predators, which include crocodiles in the same water Getting in their way when they're on land eating vegetation Getting in their way when they're going from land back to the water Walking or camping on paths where there is visible hippo dung Ignoring warning signs of an impending attack Many of my actual quotes come from an interview with scientist John Coppinger in July 2010, published in Discover Wildlife entitled How to avoid a hippo attack. These are his two opening paragraphs. In my experience, the commonly heard claim that hippos are responsible for more attacks on humans than any other dangerous animal in Africa is a complete myth. The Luangwa Valley has the densest population of hippos in Africa, yet after half a lifetime here, I am aware of only two instances of serious human injuries being caused by hippos. While there are few attacks, it would be folly to assume that these animals are not dangerous. Hippos are large and powerful, and despite being herbivores, are armed with long, lethal teeth that are designed for battle. I have seen a hippo kill a large crocodile with a single bite, and a human would offer little to no resistance if a hippo was to become aggressive. Hippos in water: Like many animals, Hippos which can live up to 50 years, are at their happiest when left alone in their habitat, which is in water deep enough to totally submerge themselves, generally at least 5 feet deep. That said, they can be very dangerous to humans, mostly because in the event of an attack, we're not likely to survive it. It is therefore vital to avoid inciting an attack in the first place, whether on land or on the water (in a boat or canoe). Hippos are vegetarian, so humans are not prey. Even if they kill one, they just leave it there. That doesn't mean we can't be hurt, just that the reasons why they hurt us are different from some other animals. We're at highest risk when we act like predators. Hippos have to spend most of their time (at least 18 hours a day) in water deep enough to cover them because their skin burns very quickly, and they get sunstroke and die. (If they're on land in the heat of the day, such as during the dry season, they secrete an interesting substance which is designed both to protect them from both sunstroke but infection. It's red, so if you've ever heard that ""hippos sweat blood"" that's what people are referring to. This article offers excellent scientific reasons for this phenomenon.) Hippos can hold their breath for up to seven minutes, although they usually come up to breathe more frequently than that. That's a built-in behavior, and they can even come up to breathe in their sleep without waking up. Hippos live in large groupings, called pods, so even if you see only one set of eyes, assume that there are more underwater, and take proper precautions. Hippos can't swim, float, or jump, so they stand and walk around in water. However, they can run up to 20 miles (32 km) per hour as long as their feet are touching the ground. The safest thing to do while boating in hippo territory is stay in water deeper than five feet, or if you're in a narrow area, stay alert. Hippos don't like vibration . When boating in hippo territory the advice is to bang on your boat with an oar or paddle, or anything that will vibrate the boat. It can prevent hippos from coming up underneath you and capsizing the boat. It's also a way for hippos to track your presence. That doesn't mean you're safe, it's just a way to buy time while you go to a deeper area. Going to an opposite shore and disembarking is a good idea, but not always practical if traveling down the river to a destination. Hippos are ferociously protective of their young and will readily come to their defense if they feel that their young are threatened in any way. This is when they're most likely to attack. Think about what you'd do if someone broke into your house with your child sleeping in the next room. In this situation, we're in their house. Hippos breed, give birth and even suckle their young under water for up to 18 months, so it's not always easy to spot the calves, unless you see them at the water's edge. Adults start at around five feet tall, so if you see one shorter than that, it's probably a youngster. The best thing to do is assume that any large group of hippos you encounter includes some young that are being protected, and stay a respectable distance away. The first obvious outward sign of an attack in water is when they open their huge mouth. What looks like a yawn is a display of large teeth from a bull (make) hippo. If it feels threatened, or angry, it then lets out a very loud grunt, which is followed quickly by the attack. If you already hear that grunt, you're getting too close, and should immediately retreat. If you can actually see it, you may be in very serious danger. The attack can be a fight between males, a grabbing of an animal predator, or something else. Human or not, anything that threatens the family is at risk. If you're near deeper water, continue on, keeping a constant beating on the boat. Don't turn back, because you already know there's a family there. If necessary, find a safe spot on the other side and disembark. The hippo's very unlikely to come up and give chase on land. It would take him away from his family, and it isn't safe for him in the heat of the day. Hippos on land: You're safe on land for most of the day, as long as you're at a respectable distance from the shore, and aren't on a path with hippo dung. However, once the sun goes down, the hippos will come out of the water to eat. They eat an average of 150 pounds of food per day, all vegetation, so they have to use their land time wisely. They're often on the shore or a nearby path for four to five hours, and can travel up to 5 miles from where they got out of the water. That's not the time to stay in their territory. When they're ready to go back to where they want to enter the water, they do it instinctively and quickly, plowing down anything in the way. If you come across a hippo on land, don't get between it and the water. Hippos are extremely fleet of foot, and will outpace humans. They move very quietly and can be very dangerous if encountered suddenly. When a grazing hippo is disturbed, it is extremely dangerous to get between it and the water as it will run blindly along its paths, trampling anything in its way. When confronted by a hippo on land, the best thing one can do is dive out of its way. Avoid hippos by not going near thickets and reeds near the water, and do not camp near hippo paths or waterholes as hippo are attracted to fires and lights. Be very vigilant during drought times as hippo will tend to concentrate in small waterholes and pans, and as they feel threatened in shallow water, will not hesitate to charge. They are quite capable of biting a human in half with little effort. During the rut, males fight viciously and often to the death, leaving opponents with severe wounds. Females normally wander off to solitary confinement in areas of reed-beds to give birth and often keep the young away from the males who may occasionally kill them. Hippos, especially in winter months, will lie up away from the water‚Äôs edge. Source. Another Source from Uganda offers this advice when a hippo's on the way to the water: If you find yourself being chased by a hippo, don‚Äôt run in a straight line. Their voluptuous figures do not allow for sharp turns, one must zigzag to get away. If need be, jump behind a tree or termite mound for cover. The Smithsonian has a beautiful story of a couple who have spent 15 years protecting an endangered pod in Zimbabwe. Although they've become as close to friends as one can get, they've spent many hours up in trees, when a hippo on land gets too close. I infer from this that if you're able to climb a nearby tree to escape, you should do so. (For animal lovers, it's a really cool article. The wife, Karen Paolillo, from Britain, is lovingly known in Africa as ""the hippo whisperer."") Another helpful way to know where a hippo is on land, is to memorize and listen for the call of an Oxpecker bird . They spend much of their time eating ticks and other bugs off the skin of the hippo. The bird call is a good way to warn you that you're in hippo territory. The bird feeds off other large animals in the area, so it's not always a hippo, but better safe than sorry. Hippos also have a very pungent odor, so if you don't see or hear anything, a sharp strong smell can alert you to their presence in the vicinity. For the best view of the hippos in water, and for your own safety, don't schedule your visit during the dry season . ( This page lists weather patterns in various areas of Africa. It can be helpful when planning your trip.) Hippos are primarily in the water for much of the year. During the dry season when the waters recede, they spend much more time on land and are much more dangerous during the dry season. They tend to be found in larger groups on land, and much of the feeding and fighting takes place out of the water. If you're walking or camping near an area where a larger group of hippos are on land, risk of fatal encounter increases greatly. On water and land, don't bother to try to distract them. They don't see well. Trying to distract them by swinging arms, clapping, or making noise doesn't work with hippos. Don't throw anything either, like rocks. It doesn't incite them, as with other animals, but it doesn't prevent attacks either. It's just wasted time that should be spent retreating. The end of the article I started with offers a good basic summary: JOHN‚ÄôS TOP TIPS If you‚Äôre in a canoe, allow hippos plenty of space. Avoid rivers where numbers are concentrated. Tap the side of the boat to signal your position so hippos do not come up beneath you. Keep your distance when on foot. Avoid thickets where hippos may be skulking. Listen out for oxpecker calls ‚Äì a warning sign that there may be a hippo around. As a last resort, use a tree or termite mound as cover. (That article didn't explain why the termite mound is a good idea, and I haven't done research yet as to the relationship between hippos and termites. However, I find that tip fascinating.) Supporting and additional references: Check out the site 10 fascinating facts about hippos from the Kariega Game Reserve in Eastern Cape, South Africa. It lists some of what I've mentioned here, and much more. There's also a beautiful video of the hippos during each part of their day, both in and out of the water.

18717,,How to measure combined clothing and sunscreen?,3*5*13,"Purely theoretical (in practice sunscreen isn't as strong as it says on the bottle to begin with) you multiply it. If 1/3rd of the UV photons make it through the first layer, and of those that made it through 1/5th get through the second layer as well, then 1/15th of the original photons made it through both layers, and 3*5=15. It's the same for tan, that's melanin, which is a pigment that's great at absorbing light. That's why it looks dark. Any light that gets absorbed does not get through to the living layer of the skin where it can be harmful, because it would need to be not absorbed to do that, so the same idea as for clothing and sunblock applies. So with three layers of protection the total factor would then be 3*5*13(=15*13=10*13+5*13=130+65)=195. Furthermore it does not matter for the protection factor whether the protecting layer reflects light away, which makes it look light or white or in special cases like a mirror, or absorbs it, which makes it look dark or black. As long as the photons don't arrive at the layer below it. (Although I guess you could make a case for several reflecting layers above each other being less effective then several absorbing layers, because they could re-reflect reflected photons back down, but that's taking this theory further than its practical purpose.)

Their bellies are full (they eat before they swarm) they have no hive to defend, and you are basically not of interest to them. Beekeepers literally gather swarms into buckets to put them into new hives. (Keep in mind, though, that they are familiar with bee behavior and can evaluate the ""mood"" of a swarm better than you can, so don't get too close.) As Wikipedia says: A swarm of bees sometimes frightens people, though the bees are usually not aggressive at this stage of their life cycle. This is principally due to the swarming bees' lack of brood (developing bees) to defend and their interest in finding a new nesting location for their queen. This does not mean that bees from a swarm will not attack if they perceive a threat; however, most bees only attack in response to intrusions against their colony. Additionally, bees seldom swarm except when the position of the sun is direct and impressive. Swarm clusters, hanging off of a tree branch, will move on and find a suitable nesting location in a day or two. Encountering a bee swarm for the first time can be alarming. Bees tend to swarm near their hives or honeycombs, so if a swarm is visible then a nest is nearby. Swarms are usually not aggressive unless provoked, so it is important to keep a good distance from swarms in order to avoid provoking them. Look at them, take a picture, leave them alone, you saw a cool thing. And yes, I have met a swarm, one actually set up on a warm sunny day in some old beekeeping equipment (including hives with not-quite-enough-frames) of my father's that we were keeping in a shed.

According to this source The state's [Florida's] biggest alligator on record is 14 feet long and 780 pounds. The article does not say if the previous record holder (PRH) had recently ate or pooped, which might make a non-trivial difference, if the OP desires great accuracy and precision. I'm glad the OP asked for an estimate , not a measurement , otherwise one would have to sedate the alligator and suspend him (most likely a him) in a sling attached to a spring balance. For a zeroth order approximation for Chubbs, one would take (15/14) x 780 and get 836 pounds. Of course Chubbs, if he had the exact morphology of the (PRH), would be larger in all three dimensions. This would give a first order approximation of (15/14)cubed x 780 = 959 pounds. To refine that number, one would look at the largest diameter (or circumference) of both alligators and adjust accordingly. Maybe Chubbs (named after a local golfer, and not his figure) is svelte relative to the PRH -- or obese. You should be able to get a reasonable approximation to the ratio of diameters from photos, the photos normalized to a 15/14 length ratio. I don't advise using a measuring tape on an unsedated alligator. Then the estimate of Chubbs's weight would be (15/14) x [D(Chubbs)/D(PRH)]squared x 780.

20986,,How would one person control two canoes?,single handed,"Lash them together in parallel with spars such that there's a wide enough gap down the middle that you can paddle in the centre. As you say, you're not going to be making tight turns, but you are in full control of both boats which is the more significant aspect. You also gain massively on stability, especially if you have other (non-able bodied) persons. This setup is suitable for use on moving water and has been extensively tested on the River Wye at Symonds Yat. You always have to look out for these guys coming through when you're playing on the rapids. The rigid structure has advantages over a rope tow as you don't get the jerk and slack as the rope comes tight then relaxes which makes paddling hard work.

21465,,How do I slow down while snowboarding?,point more across the slope,"There are basically two ways to go slower while boarding. First, point more across the slope, rather than down it. Easier said than done, sometimes. Secondly, washing off speed by letting the board move slightly sideways, rather than nosefirst. This is the equivalent of snowplough. Let's say you're regular-footed, and riding heelside, so you're travelling to your left, across a slope which is going downhill in front of you. You roll your heels back, causing the edge of the board to dig more sharply into the snow. Then push slightly with your right foot and twist your body left. The board is now turned slightly left from its previous angle, but still travelling in the same direction. The extra friction from the edge scraping in the direction of travel causes you to slow down a bit.",point more across the slope,0.163595632,65,92,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21465

Importantly, don't try to keep up with the person in front - if they are following the rule, it's up to them to slow down or stop so that they maintain contact with you. This will naturally constrain the group to the speed of the slowest member, and ensure that no-one gets left behind. As a ""group member"", you'll need to (temporarily) step up to a ""leadership"" role to instruct your peers in this rule before you start. After that, it's important to set a good example. This can be reinforced by periodically asking the person behind you to report the status of everybody further back. As an aside, this technique also works well for road vehicles travelling together, when traffic lights or other obstacles can affect part of the group.",slow down or stop,0.011190683,219,236,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21512
22031,,How to find ticks in your hair?,soapy water,"TL;DR: comb your scalp systematically with your fingers, wash your hair to remove them from hair (be careful with laundry carrying ticks home too), and try to catch/prevent them getting into your hair in the first place. Great question. I worked in the woods with long hair under a hard hat, and wow did I accumulate ticks. I'd reliably find >5 per day. I did end up getting Lyme, thankfully diagnosing and treating it early - I share that caveat to say, take my advice with a grain of salt! Still, I got a lot of experience finding ticks from that. When I was in tick prone areas, it became habitual to do tick checks of two sorts: 1) in-field quick checks to clear off clothing, and 2) end of day thorough checks to clear off body. 1) In the field: At any breaks in the day we would do a quick 'pat down' of ourselves, quickly touching and visually inspecting our bodies from head to tow. Hair was mostly neglected in these checks, but getting rid of ticks you spot in these checks reduces the chances they'll be able to settle into your hair. An important note about hair and all body parts is that we kept mostly covered, even despite brutal heat and humidity, to avoid ticks and other bugs. Pants tucked into socks, shirt tucked into pants and outer shirt over that, sometimes gloves and bandana mask when bugs were very bad. I had long hair, and I learned the importance of neatly tying my hair up in a bun resting at the back of my head and tucking it under my hard hat. For one, hair gets messy in the woods in general, and two, the way hair accumulates messiness can also accumulate ticks. Don't give them any easy platforms to catch on to, and keep your head and hair out of the bushes and grass they linger in if possible. 2) At home: Pretty soon after returning home, some privacy and a shower is necessary. Put all your clothes in the wash and/or dryer ASAP (or store them separate from 'tick-free' areas at least), clean yourself off, then touch every inch of your body with your finger tips head to toe. Get in the habit of being excessively detailed about it, you want to see and touch every part of you to catch any little bump and inspect it. It's good to get in the habit of inspecting yourself anyway. Showering before thorough inspection is helpful, especially with long hair, as the soapy water can release loose ticks from hair. When you inspect your head, the same principle of detailed inspection applies: touch every part of your scalp, combing it carefully with your finger tips. Do this systematically in rows so you cover every spot of your scalp. If you washed your hair, you've reduced the chance that some ticks are stowing away there. With long hair, doing additional feel-throughs while it's clean between trips to the woods is a good idea to catch stragglers. Other than that, keep an eye out for symptoms and bullseye marks when you've worked in a tick prone area. Lyme is unpleasant but what makes it really debilitating is misdiagnosing it for months or years: if you have potential symptoms, insist on tests or preemptive treatment.",soapy water,0.160054281,2305,2316,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22031
22816,,How to progress to harder graded problems?,Just keep going climbing,"The specifics of this are unique to the person, but in general: Just keep going climbing. There are (very broadly speaking) two factors which determine how hard you can climb. Technique, or how you move and position your body Strength, or how strong your body is Going climbing will improve both of these things. You'll get comfortable in the strange positions climbing sometimes puts you in and your muscles will get used to gripping holds of a variety of shapes. Essentially, practice makes perfect, or at least better. Now, there are ways to improve each of these things on their own ( footwork drills , hangboarding , etc.) but these are a shockingly bad idea for the V0-V2 climber. It is unlikely, as a new climber, that your muscles and tendons will respond well to targeted workouts; it is likely, as a new climber, that hangboarding will injure you. And while technique exercises won't hurt you... they're kinda boring! I suggest enjoying regular routes, and asking fellow climbers for technique advice when interested. The advice above is pretty general, but I'm guessing you're also feeling a bit of... The Plateau/The Jump This is when you feel that your rate of improvement has decreased (plateau) or the change in difficulty from one level to the next is insurmountable (jump). Perhaps when you started climbing, a V0 was doable and a V1 was very hard, but you could at least attempt it. Now you feel that V1s are doable but a V2 is impossible. This is very common, and V2 won't be the first time you experience this. Here are a few tips for getting past it. Climb more. Go twice a week instead of once. Stay at the gym for 3hrs instead of 2. Work on the parts of harder climbs that you can do. There is often a big difference in style of climb between V0-V2, and getting used to the new type of movement will help you improve. Work on individual moves at your limit. Find a few moves that look cool to you and work on them. Try them every different way you can think of. The feeling of sticking a move after trying it over and over for a week is incomparable. (optional) Ask for advice. When you're working on your one hard move, talk to the local crushers and see if they have a suggestion--it's amazing how much a well placed backstep or dropknee can change how you feel on the wall, and sometimes new climbers won't recognize (or even know) how to identify the opportunities. Above all, go out and have fun. Edit after edit to question: Most of my answer involves climbing more, and you say you can't get to the climbing gym more than twice a month. I hate to say it, but you're going to have a hard time improving significantly. As with most technical sports, you can't improve without actually doing it. Sure, you can do grip workouts and yoga and situps and more, but in all likelihood you'll get on your next V2 and it will feel just as hard as before. An analogy, in reverse: I recently started going to a regular gym. I can climb pretty hard routes on tiny crimps with huge jumps. But when I go to the gym I can only do 5 or 10 pull ups--and what gets tired first? My grip.",Just keep going climbing,0.098583102,64,88,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22816

23,,How does one dry clothes in humid weather?,in the open air,"Humidity Keeping clothing dry in normal weather can be challenging, but high humidity or precipitation regions can make this even more difficult. That's because humidity is really a "" relative "" measure and means the amount of water vapor that the air can hold at a given temperature before condensation. The condensation can occur in the sky as rain, near the ground as fog, or in your tent as water droplets clinging to the inside. The water can also cling to your clothes, if they hang inside your tent when the relative humidity approaches the "" dew point "" Dew Point The dew point is the temperature to which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant barometric pressure, for water vapor to condense into liquid water. The condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface. The dew point is a saturation temperature. This is important because if you try to dry your clothes in the open air and the temp and humidity are near the dew point your clothes will not dry, if fact they may become more wet! Many people have seen this when they get up to hike early and there is water clinging to tall grass along the trail even though there was no rain . So then how do I dry my clothes? The nice thing about dew point is that it's totally dependent on the temperature of the air. As the air temp goes up, so does the amount of water it can hold. The easiest way to increase the air temperature is to use your body, it is a constant 98-99 degrees and you always have it with you. So I am a human clothes line? Not exactly. Most likely on a long trip you brought a sleeping bag and in that sleeping bag at some point be your body. The air in the sleeping bag will be higher than the ambient temperature, and overnight your clothes will dry. Below are the basic instructions for a sleeping bag clothes dryer. Start by using a relatively dry sleeping bag. Wear a light set of polyester or other synthetic fabric base layer, which should be very lightweight. These will wick the moisture and sweat away from your body. Get into your sleeping bag and lay your clothing (wrung dry) on top of your legs and torso. Tie socks together and place around your neck Zip up the sleeping bag and try to fall asleep. Through the night, reposition the clothes on your body. After the clothes are dry, place them at your feet. They will dry quite fast, usually within 3-4 hours. Add another layer of moist clothes if you have them. Repeat steps 3-5 Suggestions for keeping clothes dry. Keep a lightweight water proof bag to put your dry clothes in during travel. There are waterproof breathable bags which pack down tight and work great for this. If you have a sunny dry day, hike with the clothes tied to your backpack. If you have lots of people in the tent with you (2-3) try making a drying line inside the tent. Remember to provide for plenty of ventilation by opening the rain fly slightly to allow for air flow. If the temp is lower (50 Deg F) but the humidity high, place clothes around your neck or torso while hiking. They can partially, or fully dry this way throughout the day. Other suggestions Boots are hard to dry when wet. Some people put mini synthetic towels in them to absorb some water, then pop them in the sleeping bag over night too. Open the zipper by your feet (if you have one), to allow for the moist warm air to escape. This also keeps your sleeping bag dryer, and warmer as a result. You can also put the clothes on top of the sleeping bag, but my experience has shown this to be less effective. There will likely be some condensation on your sleeping bag in the morning. Make sure to dry this off with a towel before it gets into the loft when you repack the bag. Extra reading on the subject...

Seek local knowledge of a climbing area before trusting existing anchors Now with that our of the way... Use the following acronym as a guide to anchor creation. E.A.R.N.E.S.T. Equal tension - Multipoint anchors must have equal tension on all anchor points. Angles appropriate - No angle of tension shall exceed 60 degrees Redundant - No single anchor point failure shall cause the entire anchor to fail. Also no anchor point should share a primary connection to any other anchor point. Non-Extending - No anchor point failure will cause other load points to be shock loaded. Strong - Each individual anchor point could hold all climbers in the case of the worst possible fall Timely - The anchor can be constructed and decontructed in a matter of time which does not cause a safety risk in itself.

The following may help, but obviously not all will be appropriate for the conditions you are camping in. Sources of water vapour: Combustion of fuel in a stove and steam from cooking - avoid cooking in the vestibule of your tent (I'm assuming you wouldn't be cooking fully in your tent). Steam from food - avoid eating hot food in your tent. Respiration/perspiration - is the tent overcrowded? Wet gear - avoid bringing wet gear into the tent unless you are trying to dry it. Pack wet gear in a survival bag and leave it outside the tent. Location - avoid camping close to marsh or other bodies of water (obviously this needs to be balanced with proximity to a source of water for cooking/cleaning). Under-tent conditions - look for dry ground to camp on, avoid thick vegetation that may be a source of water vapour. Other tips: Consider an elevated camp position; the bottom of a valley may become colder at night increasing condensation. There may also be more of a breeze to help ventilate your tent. Pitch your tent such that the vents are aligned with the prevalent wind to maximise air flow through your tent. Obviously in high winds you should still pitch your tent to minimise the chance of it being damaged or blowing away. If weather and biting insects allow, keep the tent door open to maximise ventilation. Single walled tents, while small and light, are less effective in humid conditions.

1079,,How do I choose a good quality carabiner?,Any biner from the major climbing manufacturers,"I think this depends on what exactly you want the carabiners for. Most hardware stores carry a variety of carabiners in a range of sizes, weights, and purposes. The ""S-Biner"" , for example, is a cheap, stainless steel multi-purpose clip. I use them for all sorts of household things and while camping, but there aren't really any ways to use them climbing. You'll also find bigger, multipurpose biners like [this one][1], but this type is only good to about 150 pounds. There are also biners that are very much like what climbers use (though generally heavier and stronger), such as this one . On the other hand, climbing biners are generally specific to the needs of climbers (light weight, very strong up to certain loads, specific diameters at top and bottom, wire gate, bent gate, keylock, etc.). Depending on your needs they might suit you well. A pack of six Black Diamond Neutrino biners is only $35, so if you want something that takes big loads and is still small and lightweight (and colorful!), go for it. Your best source for these types of biners would be climbers retiring their gear. Most climbers won't use gear after it has a certain amount of use, so they are often getting rid of well-used biners that aren't safe for climbing anymore. So how do you know a good quality carabiner? Any biner from the major climbing manufacturers (Black Diamond, Mammut, Omega Pacific, CAMP, Petzl - really ) will be more than enough biner for day-to-day uses. REI offers a good variety. A couple of things to note, aside from price, are the strength (almost all hardware has a strength rating stamped into it - it is often in kilonewtons [kN] or safe working load [SWL] in pounds), the size, the width of the opening, the action of the opening (is it sticky? difficult? smooth?), and the material. Most standard climbing biners are made of aluminum, for example, which doesn't mesh well with steel (so, an aluminum biner used on steel cable is bad for the biner).",Any biner from the major climbing manufacturers,0.327486902,1300,1347,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1079

If you are not comfortable with placement for any reason then you probably shouldn't be placing it there. NEVER sacrifice safety for convince. All suggestions here are for placement concerning removal NOT safety ,direction of pull or anything else. Also, there is no substitute for experience or an experienced teacher, in person, on the wall. Also, All suggestions are to be read with ""Try... if you can."" So ""Don't put it too deep or out of reach of a tool"" Becomes ""Try not to put it too deep or out of reach of a tool if you can."" It depends on if you placed it using the caming action or just as a nut. If you places as a nut then there tends to be not much of an issue. If you place as a cam, then there is usually an issue. the best advice for cleaning them is to remember that you will have to remove it when you place it. Don't put it too deep or out of reach of a tool. Don't place it as tight as you can. Place it where you have to pull on it a bit to activate the cam before it is set. Place straight in rather than slotting, much easier to get straight out rather than slide around then remove. Don't use a parallel crack when one with a downward constriction exists. Visualize how it is going to be removed before touching it. Push it on the rails to remove the caming action. Don't use your fingers. Use a nut tool from the start. Understand where the fulcrum point is on any placement and know that you will have to effect it to remove the cam. Basically release the tension on the fulcrum and then wiggle out. Once the tension is released, use the nut tool to stop it from catching and re-tensioning itself. ON the larger ones with a hole, use the hole and pull toward the sling to release the tension. Modify the sling with a straw. Cut the straw to fit just in the loop and tape it in. I use thirst buster straws because they are wide, but any should work. If the point has become really mangled use a file to return it to it's original shape. (I wouldn't do this more than once per cam before replacing) Understand that if you do fall on it, it very well might become a permanent placement. Use a sling attached to the webbing. This will allow less drag on the rope and the rope will pull on the pro less which will tension it less which will make it easier to remove and less litely to wiggle free from where you placed it.

Where you have flattish grasses, you can roll them between the palms to flatten them slightly and split the fibres apart a little - not completely, but enough to help them bind together. Using relatively dry fibres, for example, from recently dead wood will allow you to bind the cord together more tightly than wet fibres, and in fact wet bound cord may separate as it dries, so do try to choose dry fibres where possible. Avoid lining up the ends of fibres, as when you twist them together that would make a single point of weakness, so stagger the ends. Then take two strands and twist them together - the key here is that if you are winding the fibres together clockwise as viewed from the end, you must twist each fibre in an anticlockwise direction. Keeping the wrap tight is essential, especially when you bring in a new fibre - which you should overlap with the one which is ending.

All of the stuff that Kai K. has recommended I would assume you already knows without being told. In my mind, the piece about commando rappelling (very serious climbers do not do this) seems dangerous. I have been climbing in Yosemite seriously for over a decade and ascended all of the major walls there, so my experience is deep. In all those years, I have never met climber(s) that would do this on a cliff this size. Since I have done this type of repelling before, I see additional points to stress: If the overhang is severe enough, one issue is being able to stay in contact with the wall. If you bounce or push off the wall with enough force such that you come in contact with the wall again, then it will be easier for you to clip an anchor. If you lose contact with the wall, you could be left in midair which will requires take time and energy to get you back. If the anchor has no slings, it could be tricky to find them. With large cliff faces as you‚Äôve shown, I would have a daisy chain ready to clip in to an anchor in the case that there are no slings to grab. I have been in situations where I was not been able to find anchors and was force to use jumars (or ascenders) to go back up the rope. This is no small feat if you have not practiced it. If you haven‚Äôt, I strongly recommend that you do this by finding a high bridge, tying off a rope and ascending up the rope using jumars.

Not knowing that river, I can't say whether that would work or not, so I'll discuss anchoring to the bottom. This is the same procedure for anchoring in a tide or a river, except in a river you only need to worry about water in one direction, which is a lot more straightforward. In the sea the rule of thumb is to use an anchor rode 8 times as long as the water depth. This way, you are never pulling the anchor up, but always along the bottom - which aids friction. 8 may be overkill here, but perhaps 4 times is a good idea. Ideally, you'll want two anchors, each on a short length of chain (to help weigh down the rope nearest the anchor - to help further with keeping it on the bottom) with a nylon rope; and row so the two anchors are each 45 degrees off due upstream. Once they are both set, allow your raft to drift out to the full length of the ropes.

6530,-1,How do you decide on a climbing grade?,a grade of the hardest one(or more) moves on a single climb,"Where does the route setter know from which movements capabilities and skills are assigned to each grade? He doesn't. Skills != grade . Grade is a measure of difficulty. You may find you prefer a particular type of climbing (say slabs or ones involving dynamic moves, etc). you have good skills in this area. This can make climbs of that style easier for you. But grades should ignore this fact. That's why it's better to get a range of opinions when grading. Are there some general catalogues / guidelines which movements or skills are necessary to master a certain grade? No, grading is a subjective process. It's more art than science. There is no rules that say all v3s must be overhanging and use x size holds. It's purely down to how the route is set. Routes have different characteristics, these can make a climb more difficult or easier, but the route and characteristics of a climb are secondary to the grade. The grade purely exists to add a figure to the difficulty of the climb. i.e. a severely overhanging climb can be easy if it uses large well spaced holds or very difficult if it uses smaller difficult to reach holds. Moreover, there are route setter certifications for local, national and international level and a proper organization Route setting and grading is different. You may set a route at 5.2 but following feedback you may change it's grade. It's common in indoor gyms to have a route feedback form. Outdoors route grades can and do change. Also bear in mind a grade is typically a grade of the hardest one(or more) moves on a single climb . If 90% of the moves on a climb are 5+ but one move is 6a, the climb is graded 6a as that is the hardest part. I'm going to reiterate some of the answer from Rating unorthodox climbs . This is a different question but the answer is pretty much identical. Rating climbs isn't really a tick box exercise, for a start their are multiple different grading systems all of which are slightly different. You cannot say: well it's at x angle and the hand holds are y size therefore it's w There are a number of different challenges to grading climbs: Climbing grades are a rule of thumb and are open to interpretation. They are a measure of how hard it is to climb. Different people find different aspects of climbing more or less difficult so it is always open to interpretation. Indoor grades are often very different to outdoor grades, bouldering gardes are very different to Trad grades, etc, etc. Grades tend to overlap so there is very little difference between a 5.9 and a 5.10a Height of climb, length of pitches, rock type, all need to be included in the grade. This makes comparing grades in different areas difficult. This is to the point that when a new climb is ""put up"" the grade that the first climber gives it is a provisional one. This grade needs to be confirmed by one or more climbers before it is accepted. The best way to grade a climb is to gain experience of climbing well know climbs that the grade is well known and accepted. Then when you want to grade something that you don't know the grade for you need to ask yourself (and others preferably) is this harder or easier than x and y climbs? How much harder or easier? What about w climb? etc. You'll likely never get it 100% right, people argue over grades constantly. But the whole point is that it's impossible to get 100% right. It's a guide only.

6660,0,How to cross a 25 feet wide Crevasse?,avoid it or build a bridge over it,"A crevasse that wide cannot just be jumped across (unless you're among the top long jumpers of the world), therefore you have only two possibilities: avoid it or build a bridge over it. Typically such bridges are built using aluminum ladders (cf. image below) that are placed across the crevasse and fixed on both sides. In the ideal case one also builds some handrail rope to hold onto. As you can see from the image such bridges are rather permanent constructions, that need some material (ice screws, rope, webbing slings) to get it properly fixed. Also for a crevasse of 7.5m width you can plan for a minimum of 10m (better more) of ladder to have enough spare lengths on both sides for support and fixation. So this is nothing that you carry up the mountain just for the possibility to need it but you will have to plan ahead to bring the right material. It also requires some time to set it up, therefore such ladders are only of use on points where a crevasse is frequently crossed. As you say you plan or at least expect to go solo on that trip, you won't have the capacity to carry huge amounts of material. In that case your second best choice will be to find a snow bridge over the crevasse. As those bridges (and also the snowy edges of crevasses) can look firm while being quite unstable, be very careful with your safety measures. That means, create a save anchor (using ice screws, snow protection gear , or whatever is suitable for the conditions) some meters away from the edge and tie your rope there. Cross the snow bridge while you are belayed by the rope. Once on the other side, create another anchor there and fix your rope here as well. If you can afford, leave the rope there until you return to have an easier traverse on your way back (also take into account that you might need to take a fast retreat). If you can't leave the rope there, cross the bridge back again to your first anchor (of course while being secured by the rope somehow), remove the rope and anchor and get back to your second anchor by crossing the bridge a third time. You see, the snow bridge variant requires to put your life onto some anchor built into snow with the risk of hanging on a rope somewhere down in the crevasse. You should be very sure to know how to rescue yourself from a crevasse and have the necessary gear with you.

6662,-2,How to go about replacing sport climbing bolts?,part II,"In the UK this is controlled/coordinated by the BMC . They publish an extensive guide on how and when to do this Bolt Guidance Document . There is also a working group, coordinator and they even pay for new bolts. There are lot's of issues around this, the document goes into a lot of detail these. The most important one (in the context of your question) is..... When to replace bolts (sic: Bolts do fail but not very often).....After all when was the last time you heard of a bolt failing? Well it does very occasionally happen and recorded cases suggest in some situations that are hard to predict. So what factors should we take into account? Rock quality Like any other form of protection, a bolt is only as good as the rock it is placed in.....Always remember that the erosion that creates our crags has not halted. The weather and particularly cliff vegetation has great capacity to loosen and lever off even very large lumps of rock. Once sound placements have been known to change as the rock around them unexpectedly crumbles. Depth & Position of Bolt Bolts placed close to edges will have a reduced strength; 200mm is often quoted as a minimum clearance distance. Unfortunately bulging limestone doesn‚Äôt usually accommodate bolts being placed with that allowable distance. Likewise, bolts placed close to cracks, pockets or other discontinuities may well be reduced in strength. Evidence of Corrosion (Rust) ....Just because a bolt is rusty it doesn‚Äôt mean it is dramatically weakened. However, if it is rusty it has lost some metal and consequently some of its holding capacity. It is not unknown for the nut to be of a different metal and to have corroded so that it no longer holds the hanger in place. Bolts where the hanger is fresh and shiny but the bolt itself is rusty may suffer from a particular form of corrosion and have been known to break with the lightest of load. It makes sense to inspect bolts that are placed in drainage lines. Unfortunately the wettest place part of a bolt is in the hole and behind the hanger making inspection difficult. Accidental Unclipping Hangers or eyes ideally should be of a size that they don‚Äôt allow the karabiner to snag in such a way that the gate can be forced open and unclip. Correct orientation of the karabiner gate away from the direction of travel also helps avoid this. Spinning Hangers Hangers can spin because the bolt has moved in its seating or because the securing nut has become loose. If there is evidence of the former then the bolt is likely to be unsafe. If the latter is the cause then the nut should be immediately retightened. The leverage and wear caused by a weighted hanger rotating on the bolt body can give rise to weakening of the unit due to the formation of microscopic fractures. Old Bolts Despite the number of renewal programmes there are still many old bolts out there, especially ones used to protect blank sections on 80‚Äôs trad routes. Common sense dictates that bolts have a limited useful life and it is always worth consulting the guidebook to see when the route was first done or, if the gear has been replaced, when that might have been done. Whilst stainless steel products are likely to be good for a lot longer, experience has shown that many bolts placed in the past are dangerously weak after 10 years. Some early staples had no notches on their legs making them prone to pulling out relatively easily if an outwards force is applied. Wobbly or Damaged Bolts - Mechanical or Glue-Ins It makes sense to doubt the holding power of any bolt that wobbles in its hole! With glue-in bolts a problem can arise if the drill dust is not thoroughly cleaned out of the hole or if it was placed in a damp hole. Some wobbly glue-ins have been found to take quite high loads but it‚Äôs probably not sensible to test these with your own weight! Unset Glue Glues have to be mixed properly. Failure to do as instructed can result in the mixture not curing, or hardening as was designed and not holding the bolt in place. Several serious accidents have happened when climbers have come across new bolts and attempted the route without checking the glue has set. Deteriorating Glue Like the bolts themselves the glue can and will deteriorate with time though for appropriate glues this should be a very slow process. However, there is anecdotal evidence that some inappropriate glues have been used, that are not suitable for the alkaline solutions likely to be encountered in limestone rocks. Unfortunately this could mean that once sound bolts become less so, perhaps as little as two years after placement. Worn Belay Bolts If top-roping a route the climber can always arrange slings so that both bolts are weighted. This is good practice and climbers should be discouraged from top roping with the rope directly through the belay bolts, as significant wear on the eye can quickly result. Home Made Hangers Various types of bolt hanger were homemade during the 1950s and 60s. Usually these were simple angle iron (or aluminium alloy) with holes drilled in each side. A few may still be encountered on old aid routes today but generally they are now of little relevance and most have been superseded by modern bolts or other forms of protection Stress Corrosion cracking Although there is no evidence of this type of attack occurring in the UK, a number of bolts have failed by stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in Thailand and Cayman Brac so it‚Äôs worth being aware of it if you‚Äôre going sport climbing in the tropics. SCC can occur in stainless steels in aqueous chloride solutions (e.g., seawater) so the bolts on sea cliffs appear to be most susceptible. Luckily for us, there is a temperature (~50¬∞C) below which it doesn‚Äôt occur (except in very acidic conditions) so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem in the UK until global warming really kicks in. The corrosion is very localised and takes the form of cracks that can penetrate through the metal, reducing its strength to almost zero. These cracks can be very fine and difficult to detect on the surface and impossible to see how far they penetrate There is also a part II . This goes into details on how to go about actually replacing the bolts. When it comes to removing the bolts, it depends....You can sometimes unscrew them, sometimes the need chopping. TBH, it doesn't matter as you should drill a new hole, etc. for any new bolts anyway. Just make it obvious that the old bolts should not be used/remove them as best you can.",part II,0.127860442,6098,6105,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6662

I got my knowledge purely out of experience and not out of books, i paddled down the whole Rhine and in the process of it i had to change direction a few times, so i'll try to provide you with a rundown of the essential learnings. A River just flows downstream if you've never been on a river, if you've ever been on water (this includes the bathtub) the first thing you'll notice is that water is a very dynamic Element, the current of the water is dependent on multiple factors. How wide is the river How deep is the river How fast is the river Is the riverbed flat (like in canals) or is it a natural riverbed with inconsistencies like large rocks etc. Weather conditions (e.g. wind) All of this factors play a major role on a river, especially everything that happens above the water (weather) because you'll most likely got the biggest surface above the water. Below i tried to scribble my thoughts, as you see there are different signs from which you can read the river, see list below with explanations. Riverbed gets deeper - this will slow down the river, since the same amount of water has more space to flow. Riverbed gets shallow - this will speed up the river, because there's less space for the same amount of water to flow, you can identify those spots by the ""mushrooms"" the water will build here. If the riverbed falls back down again like in my scribble watch out because there might be a whirl under the surface which will feel like something is sucking your paddle down. Flat riverbed - not much surprises here, those are the parts where you can eat your lunch etc. Large Stones etc. in riverbed/uneven - You'll be able to identfy those spots by the waves building there, depending on the speed of the river this will result in whitewater, avoid this parts with your Canoe, speed of river will change between superfast and reverese. Now more details for your question ""how to travel upstream"" At the outer side of curves you'll have the current with you, this is very counterintuitive, as you see you'll have to change the side of the river from time to time, more about this topic later on. Always keep in mind that sharp stones under the surface are most likely to be at the side of the river, depending on the waterlevel this leads to capsizing or a broken boat. To change Sides of the river, you'll need to do some ferrying (see scribble below) this is probably one of the most hectic things you have to do. Because you don't want to lose distance here, and if not everybody works together you'll end up needing to cross the river again because you traveled back and need to get to the outer side again. If you travel downstream it's very counterintuitive since you have to paddle backwards to ferry across a river. In general going upstream is not much of a problem, if you know how to read the water. Just as a reminder, make sure to wear safetyequipment (livevests, and tethers) so you minimize the risk of drowning. Rivers no matter how they look have the risk of strong underwater currents which are not always possible to read, those currents really drag you down with no chance of ever catching a bit air again, always keep this in mind and you'll be save.

6930,0,How to belay on top of a pitch,"belay off the harness (an ""indirect"" belay) when belaying the leader, and off the anchor (a ""direct"" belay) when belaying the follower","Belaying Multi-pitch It's often recommended to belay off the harness (an ""indirect"" belay) when belaying the leader, and off the anchor (a ""direct"" belay) when belaying the follower. Use of an indirect belay for the leader reduces the force on the anchors, but does require consideration of how the belayer may be pulled in a fall. Use of a direct belay for the follower similarly minimizes the force on the anchor by avoiding the pulley effect. When the anchor pieces are extremely solid (e.g. bolts), a direct belay may be desirable in both cases. Still, do bear in mind that neither setup is mandatory; if a direct belay would place you in an awkward or less secure position then an indirect belay would offer, you should probably use the indirect belay and vice versa. Belaying the leader Should the leader fall before placing any protection, and continue falling past the belayer, the direction of pull then comes from below, and so the belayer must reverse their braking direction. As the belayer may not recognize the implications of this and thus not respond quickly enough, it's common to want to find some way to redirect the rope. However, an easier way to address this is for the belayer to bring their brake hand around behind their hip, rather than making a habit of braking purely downwards. Having your hand further from the device when it's locked-off may also reduce rope burns in a high fall factor situation as more rope can slip through the device before it has to also slip through your hand. If a redirect is still wanted, the leader can do this by clipping the rope into the shelf, master point, or the topmost piece of the anchor, which the belayer may unclip once additional protection has been placed. Alternatively the belayer could lower themselves a few meters below the anchor. I've also seen it suggested that the previous leader could climb slightly above the belay station in order to place an initial piece, and descend to build the belay anchor. (This makes an exception to the ""never back-clip"" rule, as back-clipping this piece lets the rope run the correct direction when the other climber takes the lead.) Redirecting the belay by clipping the anchor may slightly reduce the fall factor due to the additional rope out. However, it also means the belayer will be pulled violently into that piece when such a fall happens. The pulley effect will also multiply the force on the anchor (or the particular piece that was clipped) in contrast to a direct belay. Thus, unless the clipped piece is solid (e.g. a bolt) and the belayer can also be anchored to prevent them smashing into it, it may be preferable for the leader to simply place good protection soon after leaving the ground rather than clipping the leader's rope into the anchor.[1] (Of course, if you have an extremely solid anchor, you might also consider a direct belay.) A strong argument for an indirect belay (off the harness) is that by incorporating the belayer into the system, some of the load on the anchor is shifted to the belayer's stance. This may be helpful if the quality of the anchor or gear is in question. If you do use an indirect belay, be mindful of the direction a fall will pull the belayer. It's also advisable to clip the belay device into both the rope tie-in loop and the belay loop when doing this, in order to prevent discomfort from the harness being twisted in two different directions.[2] (Clipping the belay loop vs. clipping the tie-in loop is also a way you can further adjust the amount of force going to the anchor.) On the other hand, a direct belay (off the anchor) will be much easier to escape if something goes wrong, and essentially eliminates the weight of the belayer as a factor in catching falls. This may be beneficial if the leader significantly outweighs their belayer, but it also means that it's harder to give a ""soft catch"". It also places significantly higher forces on the anchor and gear.[3] (Along those same lines, use of a tube-style belay device such as an ATC or Reverso will allow additional rope slippage that further reduces the impact on the anchor.)

They're not as efficient to ride for long distances, but can easily be fit inside a canoe. For just biking relatively short distances, a folding bike and a collapsible canoe trailer would probably work well for your needs.","simply put the bike in the canoe, albeit somewhat precariously",0.086115785,35,97,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6948

7021,1,How to detect a crevasse on a glacier,you can probe for spaces under the surface,"If the glacier isn't snowless (aper) you can probe for spaces under the surface which should be noticed by less resistance in the snow/Firn. Still it is preferable to avoid going in regions where one would expect crevasses . This isn't easy like it is tough to know how the weather is going to evolve in the mountains. But still we could try to use some theory to spot possibly dangerous areas. Glaciers are moving, they are literally flowing. Crevasse are a result when this flow is getting influenced/restricted by e.g. elevation through rocks under the ice, different slopes or merging of different glacier flows. So it's all about the different flow velocity of the ice. This is similar to fluids. Being in your dinghy on a rock-loaded river, even when you can't see those rocks they will cause you some issues. Glacier ice is more or less solid and can only deform to a certain point, then it breaks and we are getting those inhospitable yet beautiful - this summer I was let off into one, it was impressive - crevasses. There are mainly four types of crevasses: transverse A crevasse oriented more or less perpendicular to the long axis of a glacier. Transverse crevasses typically open on a valley glacier when the terrain becomes steeper, such as above an icefall. http://www.swisseduc.ch/glaciers/glossary/transverse-crevasse-en.html longitudinal A crevasse oriented more or less parallel to the long axis of a glacier. Longitudinal crevasses typically open on a valley glacier when the glacier becomes wider. http://www.swisseduc.ch/glaciers/glossary/longitudinal-crevasse-en.html en-echelon Series of crevasses oriented at an angle to the glacier margin. These form as a result of rotational strain within the ice along the glacier's edge. They form due to the velocity difference (slower edge area compared to the faster main glacier) lateral to the moving direction of the glacier. http://www.swisseduc.ch/glaciers/glossary/en-echelon-crevasse-en.html bergschrund A bergschrund (from the German for mountain cleft) is a crevasse that forms where a moving glacier ice separates from the stagnant ice or firn above http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergschrund",you can probe for spaces under the surface,0.069661021,37,79,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7021

There are lots of forums online that discuss the use of Tyvek tarps for backpacking, to determine how water resistant your fabric is you need to know which fabric you have. The post below is from the thread, "" Is Tyvek Truly Waterproof? "" at www.backpackinglight.com Tyvek waterproofness depends on the style Hydrostatic head is a measurement of how waterproof a fabric is. It refers to the height of a water column the fabric can support before leaking. It depends on which Tyvek style you purchase as to what the hydrostatic head is. The inches hydrostatic head is less than 15 (water resistant) except for the following styles: Homewrap = 82.7, 1025BL = 53, 1059B = 56, 1073B = 59, and 1422A = 40. The above values are in inches H2O; to convert to mm H2O, multiply any of the above in H2O values by 25.4. Other than the following exceptions, Tyvek versions are less than 381.0 mm H2O (water resistant at best):1025BL = 1346.2, 1059B = 1422.4, 1073B = 1498.6, and 1422A = 1016.0. Homewrap, which has printing, is 2100.0. Unlike most light shelter materials, Tyvek maintains its original HH head through multiple wash cycles.

This indicates the pressure of water needed to penetrate a fabric. Heavy or wind-driven rain has a higher pressure than light rain. Standing on a groundsheet increases the pressure on any water underneath. Fabric with a hydrostatic head rating of 1000 mm or less is best regarded as shower resistant, with 1500 mm being usually suitable for summer camping. Tents for year-round use generally have at least 2000 mm; expedition tents intended for extreme conditions are often rated at 3000 mm. Where quoted, groundsheets may be rated for 5000 mm or more.

7590,-1,How to stay hydrated with minimum water usage,drink enough,"How much water you need depends on how big you are, how fit you are, where you are and what you're doing. For example, on Mount Everest, the average person needs to drink 4-5L of water each day just so that their body can function properly. You lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. If you're a big guy that's out of shape, breathing heavy and sweating lots while hiking through the Western Cwm, then you're going to need a lot more water than the skinny little Sherpa that's leading the way. There may be situations where 100ml per hour is plenty, I can definitely survive on less than that depending on what I'm doing, I managed to go 48hrs straight without any food and water at all while trekking out in the summer heat once, but my body definitely wasn't functioning normally. It's important to understand your own body and how much water YOU need for certain activities. This comes with experience, your friend may be able to operate on only 100ml/hour, but that doesn't mean everyone else can. Learn to recognize the beginning stages of dehydration (fatigue, headache, yellow urine) and drink enough to stay hydrated. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to budget water, then do it the same way you would budget fuel on a long drive: go slow, don't over work the engine, keep it cool, and take the easy route. Techniques for reducing water loss while hiking: Dress - In hot hot environments, you will actually retain water better by wearing long sleeve shirts and pants made out of light breathable materials. Also cover your head and neck. There are reasons why you don't see anyone in the Sahara riding camels wearing shorts and t-shirts, and the sun is only one of them. Hiking in shorts and t-shirts will keep you cooler, but so will hiking with a spritz bottle of ice water and a portable fan... Hiking in sweat-dampened clothing may not feel like it keeps you quite as cool, but keeping the sun off your skin will heat your body less, and you won't lose water into the air through evaporation quite as fast. Breathing - Close your mouth. Breathe through your nose. You're sinuses preform a function beyond producing excess amounts of mucous when you get a sniffle. At the very least exhale through your nose. Leaving your mouth wide open while you hike will dehydrate you just as fast a sweating. Move at a pace that your respiratory system can keep up with. Toileting - Hold it (if you can). Sometimes when people get moving, other things get moving too. You need to give your large intestine enough time for it to reclaim as much water as it can from your stool. Relieving yourself multiple times will also relieve you of extra water in your stool. In more desperate situations, try to soak up as much of that precious moisture as you can before discharging your bowels.

7792,,How should I traverse fields with horses in?,dismount and walk around calmly,"Often in British countryside you'll find fields with horses in (and cows and much of this is applicable to bovine) where it is unavoidable or rather difficult to go a different way and the are a few things to be aware of. Usually you'll be heading over something similar to this: As public rights of way here allow footpaths through any field, garden, park, etc etc. I've walked through many a front or back garden whilst people are sitting out in summer (Kinda awkward!) but it's how footpaths work here. Firstly if you do come across a field with horses in, before entering the field take a good look around you, if the horses are far away, then enter the field and keep yourself, any children, or dogs close to you, with dogs on a lead (though child leads are not uncommon for toddlers!). Walk around the edge of the field to the other exit. Try and keep children and animals quiet too. Pretty simple if that's the case, but not always will it be so. If the horses are scattered, stick to your chosen path around the field. Don't think to cut across unless you feel confident and it's not a large field. If it's muddy, which is common, try not to make a lot of fuss, I've seen horses spook at their own shadows. If the horses are close to the gates, never fear. Actually that's a valid point and not a saying. Don't act skittish, keep your head up, don't make eye contact and sensibly navigate the horses keeping to the front, a bite is better than a kick. Always avoid approaching the horses where possible, and definitely don't bother feeding them (most likely they're going to be on strict diets and an apple from every stranger won't help!). If you're cycling through horse fields the above is all completely applicable, but the best advice I can add is to dismount and walk around calmly. Also bear in mind that in the UK people can possibly be riding in these fields, I used to gallop down the fields in summer and often had to deal with people who did not look around before rushing out into our fields.",dismount and walk around calmly,0.321020901,1764,1795,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7792

8204,1,How to light a fire with wet firewood?,using lots of extra kindling,"I'm from British Columbia; lots of BC is technically a rain forest, which pretty much means you're always starting your fire with wet wood. The trick to getting wet wood to light is to generate a lot of heat when you first start your fire - that means using lots of extra kindling . Cut triple or quadruple the amount of fine kindling and build yourself a thick teepee with a good amount of tinder to get it started. Regardless of how wet a log feels on the outside, if you split it open, the centre will be relatively dry, so use that for your tinder and smaller kindling. When you build your fire with lots of wood it's easy to smother your tinder, you need good airflow with wet wood, so make sure it can breathe. Your goal is to get a lot of flame as soon as you light it; this flash of heat will help you get some hot coals quicker, which will dry out the rest of the wood. Completely build your fire before you light it; this helps the fire grow faster once it's lit. You risk your fire burning out if you try to light your tinder first then build it up after it's lit. To help keep your fire going, stack your fuel wood around the fire like a wind screen; they'll catch a lot of the heat off of your fire and dry out a bit before you need to use them.",using lots of extra kindling,0.141210526,252,280,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8204

These types of closures are not as user friendly, but apparently leak less, and are able to hold back a lot of pressure which is why they're used on the fancy Geigerigs : These ones aren't super easy to fill in flowing water, you need to use two hands and depending on the flow they tend to spill a lot.

When shopping for this stuff, go for the most ridiculous name that you can find. Mine was labelled ""mold annihilator"". If you can find one with an image of Vlad the Impaler or Hitler, even better, go for those! Otherwise, buy the one with longest list of warnings. They usually contain bleach.

9145,,How is a fifi used in aid climbing?,a hook that is attached to your harness,"And how is the need for it replaced with a daisy chain? Here you are confusing something: With an adjustable daisy chain you do not need a fifi anymore. Using a standard daisy chain you need a fifi when aiding. How is the fifi hook used in aid climbing? First let me describe what a daisy chain and a fifi are: Daisy chain: This is a webbing sling that is sewn together at regular distances. Usually about 2 bar tacks are used, so they are not very strong (about 3kn). Therefore they can break when loaded with e.g. a fall. This is not a problem as long as you clip into just one loop. Never clip in over two loops, then you will disconnect from the sling when the bar tacks in between fail. If correctly attached, the breaking of the bartackes can even reduce the impact absorbing energy. Fifi: A fifi is simply a hook that is attached to your harness. When aiding you have two daisy chains and a fifi attached to your harness. On the ends of the daisy chains is a biner with a ladder each. One of those is set up at the current pro (a nut, cam, ...) and you placing the next pro. When done you clip in the biner on the other daisy chain and step onto the ladder (using both your hands). To get your hands free and get as much reach as possible for the next go, you attach the fifi in a loop of the daisy chain at the desired distance to the pro. This ca of course also be directly the attachment point of the pro, to get as close as possible. Then your load is on one foot in the ladder and on your harness via the daisy and fifi. Now you can push upwards with your foot and the fifi/daisy will provide the pull towards the wall. You reach the next placement and repeat. What other uses does the fifi hook have?

9256,,How to tow a canoe with a bicycle?,a tow bar,"This answer is based on a 17-foot plastic Coleman canoe with an aluminium frame. The length and the plastic increase the challenges. I have over 100 miles experience now, with legs of 14 to 15 miles. After much online research I purchased a Seattle Sports All Terrain Canoe Center Cart ; there is an option that includes a tow bar to connect it to your bike, but that is for a max of 16 foot canoe. The Seattle sports hitch is a low mount hitch; most of the home made solutions you find on Google are high mount: see What are the safety concerns of a high vs a low mount trailer hitch? Pretty much all the commercially available carts are designed with a couple of padded rest points that your canoe or kayak will rest on. This might be OK for short distances or with an empty hard-shell (fiberglass type) boat with nothing in it, but for a relatively soft plastic canoe, loaded with gear, traveling more then a mile or so, in warm (or hot) weather, the issues start to build up. Problem one: a trailer hitch. See Trailer connection, off the shelf parts and proven performer , for my solution. Problem two: keep the canoe on the cart. The strap that comes with dolly is not going to work, I tried several variations and a single strap is problematic for any distance. Every time you hit a pothole the dolly moves a bit. Pretty soon the dolly has slid back and is partly sideways; your 3-foot wide canoe is making a 5-foot wide swath behind you. I tipped the canoe over on my first outing, brushing against a pole, had to stop every mile and recenter it. Solution is four straps; the image shows 5, but the center strap turned out not to be required (and is more likely to wear ( break ) when you brush against things. Two straps pulling the dolly back and center, two straps pulling the dolly forward and center. I used 15-foot ratchet straps in the front, and wrapped around the trailer hitch before hooking to the seat. You don't need much pressure; it just needs to be snug. Problem three:The plastic hull is resting on the padded bars of the cart; this was okay at first, but the warm weather and time started causing the canoe to be come deformed. I tried using a strap between the bars for the keel to rest on, but I started to notice the canoe rubbing on the cart wheels ( and damaging the canoe ). Solution build a wood deck on the dolly. There is a space for the keel; now most of the weight is carried by the keel. The large flat area ( shaped to minimize pressure points ) provides balance and are helps to reshape the hull. It is easier to get and keep the boat centered on the cart. This added a couple of pounds, but it has been more then worth it. The canoe can't rub against the tires. I actually picked up about 2 miles per hour on the first outing with the wood deck. Although not shown on any of the images above, I also used a bungee cord to support/lift the hitch a way up the seat post. Without it the hitch would occasionally drag on the rear tire. Pulling the Canoe Actually towing the canoe is not as bad as I had expected. It is heavy, and the cart tires are relatively wide. Racing bikes have skinny tires for a reason: less friction. Here, I have all terrain tires on the bike and the canoe dolly. All of which means it is harder to go fast. It also means you go over rough terrain easier and have more control, so it is trade-off. It is long, I mean really long. The national move yourself trailer rental company (US) does not even rent a trailer as long as the canoe. AND because the dolly is in the center of the canoe, it pivots in the center of the canoe when you turn. When taking a sharp corner the back of the canoe can swing out 8¬Ω feet (nearly 3 meters): if you are on the center line of a road, and turn sharp, the canoe could hit a car parked on the side of the road. I recommend you practise turning, well away from things that might get damaged ( e.g. in an empty parking lot ). With some practice, you can tow on roads without difficulty and on most areas of bike paths fine. Slow down for corners; get off and walk everything around narrow corners. Sometimes the bike must be carried or disconnected from the canoe to make it through tight corners or narrow areas. My canoe is about 3 feet (1 meter) wide; many bike paths in the US have posts to prevent motor vehicles from going on the path, These seem to mostly have about 3¬Ω to 4 feet of space between them so the canoe does fit. You will want to walk through while learning but now I am able to bike through about 95% of them. Get lined up well before you get to the posts and don't turn until the entire canoe is through (the tail will swing and hit a post). Expect the canoe to rub in tight spots even if you are moving it by hand; bring extra straps to connect it to the dolly.

9507,,How do you get better at static climbing?,bouldering,"I'm a very static climber, but back in the day I was one of those climbing cave rats who campused and dyno'd his way through as much of a problem as he could. The key to becoming a more static climber, is to learn more technique and balance . I learned how to be a static climber from bouldering . You can learn a lot from reading a book, or watching some videos, but the best way to learn is to have a skilled climber teach you footwork and different handholds, and then practice a lot at your local climbing gym. I learned all my technique from hanging out at the wall and projecting bouldering problems with climbers who were way out of my league. The thing I love most about the climbing community is everyone is always very encouraging and keen to share their knowledge and offer advice. Bouldering is a great way to learn technique and develop strength because you're doing short strenuous climbs that usually revolve around doing one or two very specific moves, as a beginner you almost learn a new move every time you climb a new problem, especially if you're with a group of people all trying to project the same problem, because unlike sport climbing where you're usually by yourself up on the wall, bouldering is a very social sport, with a group of people all hanging out on the ground while one person tries the problem out at a time. A few exercises you can do on your own to learn more balance and climb more static, is first of all, learn how to crimp , and climb more routes that use lots a tiny crimps and slopey sloper holds. Crimps and slopers are terrible to hang onto, as you can easily pop or slide off just by changing your body position, they also require a lot of finger and core strength, which makes them perfect for learning how to static climb, because you're forced to learn balance in order to make any use out of them. Teeny tiny crimps are one of my favorites because you can't just grab at them like a big jug, you have to get your fingertips on them, settle into a good crimp and then lock off your thumb before shifting your weight. Slopers are another favourite for a couple of reasons, first of all they're next to impossible to injure yourself on-they're very tendon friendly (unlike crimps)-secondly, they give you great abs. Slopers are the holds you notice a lot of people screaming in the gym to hang onto them, that's because you have to tense up your core a lot in order to keep them. I used to practice crimps and balance by traversing my local wall (which was textured) without using any holds. It took me a very long time before I had fianlly figured out the beta to get all the way across, and there'd be some parts where I'd be flexing every part of my body just so I could cross my left hand one hand width over my right. Footwork is hugely important when static climbing, one drill you can try to teach yourself better footwork is to consciously move your feet two or three times every time you move a hand once. Footwork is key for good balance. Another way to learn footwork is to climb one-handed. with only one hand on the wall, you naturally are forced to rely a lot more on your feet. Lastly, another fun drill to try in order to make you climb more statically is to climb blindfolded . You aren't going to be dynoing to anything you can't see, and being blind naturally makes you very cautious, so you slow down and spend more time feeling your balance trying to find holds in places that make sense for how your body is balanced vs. trying to jump up and grab that big tempting jug you can see higher on the wall. Static climbing is ""smarter"" climbing, the more you think your way through a climb, the more static you're going to be.",bouldering,0.13771154,285,295,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9507
9638,,How to keep my legs warm in winter?,knee length fur / wool lined boots,"One thing you can look into are long-legged thermal underwear - this wouldn't effect how you look on the outside as they go under your clothes and create an insulating layer to help keep you warm. Women can get away with this in everyday life with a nice pair of tights. So for city life, as you stated, this should mean no difference in your every day appearance. You have mentioned keeping your core warm, and that's great - as your core is warmer the blood that flows from your torso will be warmer, helping to warm your legs, arms and extremities. This is relative but I often find I feel better in general with a nice toasty torso, even if it's just a placebo effect. Another option that's useful for women (sorry guys, you might not be able to pull this off!) is knee length fur / wool lined boots - this is something I tend to do all winter, when not actually hiking. When hiking and wearing my ankle length hiking boots I'll often wear a long pair of socks under my trousers, and my thick walking socks over these (with my trousers sexily tucked in!) - but again this is mimicking the effect of thermal undies, just up to my calf.

9849,,How to react to cattle charging towards you?,don't put your self in that situation,"In the UK (we don't have many dangerous animals) cows are the most dangerous animals you're likely to come across. They kill about a dozen people every year. Typically most deaths are caused by herds trampling people/farmers. A lot of people are wary of bulls. In my experience a herd of mother cows is more dangerous, especially if the cows think you are a threat (i.e. have a barking dog snapping at their heels). The single most dangerous situation is a spooked herd running at you in a confined space. So don't put your self in that situation. Typically, like many things, prevention is better than reaction. So always be aware of cows in a field. Couple of things to be wary of: Do the cow(s) have calves? This is typically how most people get into trouble, a mother cow will protect her calf. Do you have a dog with you? Keep dogs on leads in fields with cows. If your dog is attacked by a cow, don't try and save it , a dog will outrun a cow, you won't! Is it a single cow approaching or is the herd stampeding? A single cow is likely more scared of you than you are of it. Just stand your ground, make a lot of noise, it will likely just run away. If the herd is stampeding or a bull is running at then you're in trouble , get to the edge of the field ASAP, try and get something between you and the cow(s). Stay visible, and make a noise . Cows are not predators (Taken from Tim B's answer), they're not out to get you. But a startled cow will run and this may be towards other people or yourself, if it feels threatened. So make your presence known. Making a noise may attract some careful attention, the cows may think they're getting fed. Don't be too alarmed by this, it's normal and they just think you're the farmer. Typically (I find) cows with calves or bulls will stay out of your way rather than approach you like this. Is there a bull in the field? If yes, is it alone or with other cows? A bull with cows is likely to be more territorial than a lone bull off season. Is it breeding season? Bulls will be more aggressive when rutting, hence a bull with cows is more aggressive than on its own. If in doubt (regardless of where the footpath may go) walk around the edge of the field, avoid the cows as best as you can. Farmers are typically happier for you to do this than stamp though their fields anyway. Try not to antagonise the cows (especially if they have calves). In the UK fields with bulls in must be marked.

9920,,How much sea water can I safely drink?,#NAME?,"How much sea water can I safely drink? = None If you drink sea water, how much fresh water do you need to drink to off set the sea water you drank? = 2.8 units of distilled water per 1 unit of sea water ( to neutralize without adding hydration ) The ""scientific"" answer to this question involves a lot of complex math, human physiology and significant variables. In its simplest form the question has one concept and two factors Concept Tonicity: in the same way that water in a container always wants to be at the same level (flat) it also wants to contain the same amount of salt. Humans are ""Bags of Mostly Water"" that need to keep a specific ratio of salt to water, when the ratio of salt to water becomes too great the body dies of dehydration. Factors Normal Saline is a medical grade mixture of salt and water. It contains essentially the same amount of salt and water as a normally hydrated human. If you drink this it will not increase or decrease your hydration ( you won't get more or less thirsty ). It contains 9 grams of salt (NaCl) per liter of water. Salinity of seawater: , there are a lot of variables, but on average seawater has a salinity of about 35 grams per liter of water. Conclusion To keep the balance of added salt and added water to a human body. You need to add them in the in the ratios as they are present, 9 grams per liter. Seawater has 35 grams per liter of salt, if we mix one liter of distilled (no salt) water with one liter of seawater, we have 17.5 grams of salt for each liter of water present. When you do the math (3.5 / 0.9 = 3.8) it turns out you need a total 3.8 liters of water to get the same ratio of salt to water. So you need to add 2.8 litters of distilled water to your 1 liter of seawater to be neutral (isotonic). It ain't simple There are a lot of variables, and even some controversy . In the end it is undeniable that if obtaining fresh water is difficult, drinking some seawater is not going to make things better. If you are in survival situation, there is no ""safe amount"" of seawater you can drink. Sweat Per a comment about salt loss with sweating, I did some research. You lose about 900mg of salt per liter of sweat. Gatorade restores about 450mg of salt per liter. Sea water has 35 GRAMS of salt per liter that is 35,000mg. Drinking sea water, because you are sweating while lost at sea, is not a good idea. Disclaimer This answer is based on compiled research, most of the sources listed are Wikipedia.

We've never had to deal with a tent encased in strong ice. Usually we'll reposition the pegs and ties because the tent has slumped from the moisture and then ice, but we just manually knock any of that ice off too. We haven't had to deal with more than a day or two of below freezing temperatures, so your conditions may be more extreme than ours. Our main experience has been with snow, which is easy to knock off even from the inside -- but that is not pertinent to your question. We have not noticed any degradation in our tent because it was subjected to frozen precipitation and below freezing temperatures for a couple of days. We have a three season tent. If you have a four season tent, resistence to very cold conditions should be part of the design. In my opinion -- it is just an opinion -- the UV of strong high altitude sun and leaving the tent tightly packed in its stuff sack for long periods between trips shorten the life of a tent more than cold. In summary, my advice is to manually bang off as much ice as you can, then swab the tent off with a towel or sweatshirt, then pack the tent loosely, if this is practical, and spread it out at the first opportunity.

11111,,How to attach snowboard to backpack during skitour?,dedicated attachment straps on the back,"There are three important aspects: Maneuverability, exposure to wind and firm attachment. The optimal orientation for all of those is vertical. Most of the board is then covered by the body so there is minimal added wind resistance compared with horizontal mounting, were most of the board sticks out on the side and act as a huge sail. With horizontal mounting you have a much higher moment of inertia. So turning is awkward and you will much easier catch branches and the like (even though that can happen with vertical mounting too above the head, but much less). Firm attachment is also better, as you can fixate it farther apart, as backpacks are usually longer in height than they are in width. So ideally you have a backpack designed to do tours with a snowboard. They have dedicated attachment straps on the back and are opened by zips along the backpack brim or even on back. This allows you to reach your stuff even with mounted board, which is very awkward with they usual closing with a top pocket and a strap on the outside towards the bottom. If you do not have such a dedicated backpack you need some kind of attachment points on the top and bottom of the pack. Many backpacks have straps on the side on the top and the bottom to mount skis or to compress them. You can use two additional straps (not part of the backpack itself) that you feed through those straps on the side so that they run twice from side to side over the backpack. Then you insert your board such that the lower binding is just above the lower strap, which keeps it from sliding down. Then you also attach the upper strap and tighten both. If your backpack is not filled up quite will, you will also have to tighten the straps on the side to make it stable. This is my usual setup as skier when I carry a board of a participant and it gives a very secure fix, but the problem with opening the backpack remains. So this is fine for occasional use, but if you like doing snowboard tours it is well worth to invest in a dedicated backpack.",dedicated attachment straps on the back,0.110075414,781,820,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11111

I'd like to know which kind of arrow would slow down or kill a bear Every arrow with a broad-head (= hunting point) attached. It doesn't matter whether it's made out of wood, aluminium or carbon, if the arrow fits you and your bow. Which vital spots should I aim at The lethal zone which is in that case the heart and the lungs. As there was the request for a more scientific anatomic picture, I've added one here. However, it's a little bit gross and that's why I put it behind a spoiler ""carpet"". This image is a little bit gross You hopefully can identify the heart which is the thing to aim for. The lungs are kind of around but more above it. You can see here where the arrows should ""sit"": Which kind of bow should do the job Just like the arrow section: every bow on earth can do the job if it's strong enough. Nowadays you would choose a compound or recurve bow. If you like to shoot a long-bow it doesn't matter either. The problem is that it has to be incredibly strong. Too strong for most untrained shooters. That leads us to the next point... What is the minimum weight of a bow to bring down a bear Okay, let's start off with the kinetic energy you need to ""put in the bear"" in the worst case (full featured grizzly bear). It's 70 ft. lb. or 95 Joule. Check out this chart for example from Big Game Logic : Let's take an arrow which weights 500 grains. It's something one would use to stand against something like a grizzly. To get the energy of 70 ft. lb. it needs to travel with at least 250 fps (feet per second). We need to find a bow which can accelerate a 500 gr arrow to 250 fps. A Bear Archery Grizzly with 48 pounds manages to accelerate a 503 gr arrow to 140 fps. So approximately you'll need at least 65 pounds. A Bear Archery Grizzly isn't even build with this poundage :) However, back in the days Grizzlies were shot with a 55-60 pound Grizzly-bow (that's why the name). I'm a well trained archer (about every second day) and would overestimate myself even with a 50 pound bow. Which diameter and broad-heads to use for bears A small diameter since you need penetration. Shafts like the Axis should do the job. I would recommend three-bladed broad-heads cause bears have quite thick skin and you want them to bleed, don't you? P.S.: Just a safety advice: a bear isn't something to f%!¬ß with even with a gun =) An untrained (in terms of archery) person is never ever able to bring one down even with a perfectly set up compound bow.",70 ft. lb. or 95 Joule,0.188936055,1304,1326,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11134

This is relevant as it covers the most basic necessities for survival and rescue in case of emergency. However, I imagine those intentionally venturing and living out in the wild with purpose would prepare a little differently (time and place differences aside). The overall pattern of these basic survival necessities is phrased more or less by survival instructor Dave Canterbury as ""5 Cs of Survivability: a cutting tool, a combustion device, cover, a container, and cordage."" Another example may be found in Long Range Recon Patrols which appears to be an extensive modern take/application related to this question. It is military in context but can apply to individuals or small groups, and civilian activities of scouting and recon of the Great Outdoors. For one look at it: This Survival Outpost web page outlines some military history & civilian context, mindset, and gear for this sort of thing, along with a story of testing it out. Boiled down: the context is gathering info on an environment while leaving minimal trace; the mindset is patient and focused tuning into the environment; and the equipment covers the categories of survival (fire, water, shelter, food), self-protection, observation kit, and health (sanitation kit, medical kit, and trauma kit), with more specific gear included in the lengthy article. Lastly, general backpacking and trekking information may offer a lot of insight to answer this question in a modern context. Will have to sum some of that up later but there is lots of info on it. The difference with this might be that treks and backpacking trips tend to be a brief, occasional adventure rather than a regular occupation such as it might have been for a pre-Columbian scout going out weeks at a time. American Frontiersmen of 1600-1800s The Wikipedia article on Mountain Men Mode of Living is very relevant, generalizing gear and lifestyle of early-mid 19th century explorers of the American frontier: Most trappers traveled and worked in companies. Their typical dress combined woolen hats and cloaks with serviceable Native American-style leather breeches and shirts. Mountain men often wore moccasins, but generally carried a pair of heavy boots for rough terrain. Each mountain man also carried basic gear,[7] which could include arms, powder horns and a shot pouch, knives and hatchets, canteens, cooking utensils, and supplies of tobacco, coffee, salt, and pemmican. Items (other than shooting supplies) that needed to be ""at hand"" were carried in a ""possibles"" bag. Horses or mules were essential, in sufficient number for a riding horse for each man and at least one for carrying supplies and furs.

They should be larger than regular earthworms, lively when touched, and ""juicy"" (lots of crud comes out when you cut them up). In my experience, nightcrawlers are VERY resilient, given that you always do the following: Anytime they are not being used for fishing they should be stored in the refrigerator. I always put them on the top shelf to make sure that they don't accidentally freeze. They should always be in a slightly moist environment. When storing, the fridge should be totally fine. When transporting, I usually just make sure there is ample dirt in the container which helps to hold the moisture. As long as you do these two things I have found that most brands of nightcrawlers will last MONTHS. You may notice that after a few hours of fishing, your worms will begin to get floppy and less active. This is not a big deal as long as you can get the worms immediately back into the fridge after fishing (max of about 6 hours out of the fridge at a time), I have found they will rebound and be totally fishable after a few hours in the coolbox. One thing I usually do is only take the amount of worms that I think I'll need for my fishing session out of the container and leave the rest in the fridge. (old Chinese food takeout containers work very well, provided you wash them out) making sure to add some dirt into my travel container as well. It is not clear from your question, but if there are no holes in the container I would poke a few to help the worms breathe. As far as knowing when they have died, it should be pretty obvious.

13583,,How to quarter an elk in the field,without exposing his guts,"Here is how Bob Robb field dresses his elks. Warning: There are images of actual elks being quartered. Secure the Elk Before any cutting begins, you have to secure the elk, which often has expired on a steep sidehill. That‚Äôs where the cord or rope comes in, used to tie antlers or legs to a tree or bush to hold the animal in place as you work. Point the butt downhill if you can. It should be said that butchering an elk is much easier with two people, so if you can get some help, you‚Äôre advised to do so. Field Dress or Quarter Your Elk? There are two ways to clean any big game animal, including elk. You can do the basic field-dressing routine, which means first gutting the animal. Or you can take the quarters, backstrap, and neck off without gutting. I do both, depending on circumstances. The basic field dressing procedure is the same as it is with deer and other big game, so we won‚Äôt detail it here. You remove the innards, including the anus, taking care not to puncture the bladder or stomach and spilling their contents onto the meat. Suffice it to say, this is not a good idea. Make sure you remove the heart, lungs, and esophagus. I field dress an elk when I am not going to be able to finish the job right away, as when I might have to leave the carcass to cool overnight before packing it out. When I do this I lay the animal on its back, then cut the front shoulders so they lay out away from the carcass, and cut the hams to the ball joint so they too, are opened up enough to cool down. However, these days I prefer to simply quarter the animal without exposing his guts. It‚Äôs less messy and smelly, and you don‚Äôt lose any meat. To do that, roll the elk on one side and use your knife to remove the hind quarter through the ball joint, and front shoulder by cutting behind the scapula, leaving the hide on until the quarter is either hung or ready for boning and insertion into the meat sacks. That helps keep dirt and crud off the meat itself. Next remove the backstrap, half the neck meat, and the meat off the outside of the rib cage or, if you like, use your saw to cut the ribs completely off. I rarely do this, though. You then roll the elk over and repeat. To get the tenderloins out ‚Äî they‚Äôre located inside the carcass, on each side of the backbone ‚Äî use the lightweight saw to cut through the tops of the rib cage and remove them this way. When ready for bagging, skin the quarters out. Voila! One butchered elk, without the big mess of field dressing it first. I virtually always bone my elk meat out, for two reasons. One, it gets rid of excess weight that I don‚Äôt have to pack down the mountain. And two, removing the bone opens the meat up and facilitates cooling. Thick chunks of elk meat, like those found on the hams and neck, will spoil quickly near the bone unless they are cooled properly. Boning helps this process. Hunters with the luxury of pack horses often like to keep the bone in, as it can make loading quarters into pack boxes easier. Some hunters like to take the liver, heart, and tongue, all of which make some fine eatin‚Äô. An elk liver is about the size of a football, the heart like an elongated softball, so you‚Äôll have plenty of extra packing if you want them. I often do. When I hunt for large game, I go with some buddies of mine and we split up while hunting. We only take one kill at a time and everyone helps in the field dressing and quartering. The meat is divided up evenly. It is a lot of weight to carry out of the bush by yourself. Your Elk is now quartered and ready to be tied onto your framepack. I would use a cotton rope as a nylon rope will stretch and become loose during the trip out. Tie it on securely and have fun. If the Elk weighed 600 pounds live, you are looking at nearly 100 lbs. on your back to pack out. You will have to make 4 trips, and each trip gets harder and harder. That is why you may want to hang the remaining quarters (with block and tackle) if you are near trees with branches to support them, to allow them to cool off. - Quartering an Elk",without exposing his guts,0.300570697,1567,1592,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13583

14096,,How do you tap a tree for sap?,Using a cordless drill,"Sugar Maple trees are by far the most popular trees that people tap for sap. So I will use this as my example of how to tap a tree. The following is taken from: Common Sense Homesteading. Identify Maple Trees and Wait for the Right Temperature Range. There are many species of maple trees. The sap gathered from all of them can be boiled down into syrup. Read more about Maple Tree Identification. Most syrup is produced in the northern states, but can be made as far south as Tennessee. The temperature must drop below freezing at night and rise above during the day for the sap to run. Trees should have at least a twelve inch diameter before being tapped. When the maple trees start budding, sugaring is over, as the sap produces bitter syrup. Gather Your Syrup Making Equipment. Traditional maple syrup making equipment includes sap spouts, buckets, and covers; which are available in hardware stores, from maple sugaring equipment suppliers, or used from other sugarmakers. To tap the trees you will need a drill and bit, and a hammer. The minimum that a backyard sugarmaker must do is to drill the taphole and tap in the spout. To collect the sap: Milk jugs or even plastic bags can be hung on the spout; or plastic, food-grade tubing can be connected to the spout and the sap run into a bucket or collecting tank on the ground. Using a cordless drill to tap maple trees. Tap the Trees. Tap the trees in the early spring, as daytime temperatures rise above freezing. Drill a hole the size of your spout, at a slight incline. (Note angle above.) Tap the spout into the hole firmly, hang the bucket, and put the cover on to keep out rain and bugs. This is the magic moment, as the first drop of clear, sweet sap runs off the spout ‚Äì often onto an eagerly waiting tongue! Gather the Sap. Sap is perishable, and should be gathered and boiled daily, or kept cold in a storage container until boiling. Filter the sap to remove any impurities.

Dr Fogg says tweezers were not an option as simply pulling the leech off could leave its head lodged in the eyeball , leading to infection. A check of the medical literature revealed two other suggestions - using an anaesthetic on the eye to put the leech to sleep, or salted water. The woman's husband had made an earlier unsuccessful attempt using salted tap water, before she went to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital. ""We numbed the eyeball so we could have a better look at it... but the leech wasn't apparently affected by it,'' Dr Fogg says. Salt crystals also posed some risk of being ""abrasive to the eyeball'' and so doctors turned to a hospital staple - saline solution which has many uses, including being used in intravenous drips for people who lack enough salt in their blood. Also Saline solution was now recommended for the treatment of people with leeches on their eyeballs , and Dr Fogg says that was not as rare as it sounded. This report says that cooking salt and pulling with forceps were used to remove the leach The mass was identified as a tiger leech 'Haemadipsa picta' (Figure 1a).

15096,,How long should a down sleeping bag last?,10-15 years,"Per Western Mountaineering , American manufacturers of high quality down sleeping bags, Down also is known to have the greatest longevity, and it will outlast any other insulation by 3 to 5 times, making it the most economical choice after its initial investment. Having worked in specialty outdoor retail, I would describe your situation as unusual but not rare (if that makes sense). If properly cared for, as you have described, high quality down will last for numerous sleeping & compression cycles. When a sleeping bag is being stored uncompressed, there is very little degradation that occurs to the insulation. Instead, it is the repeated compression cycles of being stuffed and unstuffed, as well as oils and dirt, that degrade the insulation. With regular weekend use, a down sleeping bag can often last 10-15 years, especially for higher fill power down. In comparison, a synthetic bag might begin to feel colder in as little as 3-4 years. In professional use (e.g. a mountaineering guide), where the bag is being slept in every night and frequently stuffed and unstuffed, a down sleeping bag will begin to feel colder somewhere around 300 nights. All of this, of course, depends on the particulars of the situation. Also consider that a sleeping bag generally encounters low amounts of wear and tear when compared to almost any other piece of gear--it will spend its time outdoors almost always either safely inside a backpack or inside a tent / bivy sack. As a parting thought, the difficulty for manufacturers to source high quality down has actually increased over recent decades--fewer people are eating geese.

18850,,How to avoid trespassing in the United States?,you should know positively where you are,"In order to avoid trespassing, you should know positively where you are. The easiest way to do this is with a high quality GPS with a public lands map package such as those offered by OnX Hunting Maps: https://www.onxmaps.com/ . Relying on fencing, fence style, and other notices might work for well-traveled areas, but if you are off-trail, on a waterway, or other entry to private land that isn't usual, you may inadvertently enter private land. This can get especially confusing in areas where public lands are used for private grazing as often the grazing permit holders try to make public lands look private, which is bad for everyone. In general, you will have a land ownership idea in mind, such as traveling a national forest, BLM parcel, or other public land. By knowing the boundaries and double-checking with your GPS, you can determine when you are passing out of land you know you have a right to be in. If you aren't sure where you are or where the boundary to the public land is, then stay where you are sure. This is especially important when hunting or fishing, as sometimes heightened penalties apply to trespassers engaged in this activity. I have a relatively large parcel of land next to a public piece of land and I am continually dealing with trespassers. Many are harmless, but some are not such as people accessing hidden pot growing operations, so my response is generally pretty gruff and often I am armed until I know which category people fall into, so expect to be treated as a potential threat until proven otherwise when you are found on someone else's land. Keeping property completely posted is often difficult due to weather removing signs and people simply ripping them down. Fencing is also sometimes down for a few weeks before I notice. The onus is on the traveling party to know where they are and whether or not they have a right to be there in most of the Western United States. There are different requirements for civil and criminal trespass and generally criminal trespass laws require someone to remain after being asked to leave and/or proper signage.

Sails are never designed to fit tightly within any kind of frame. To be effective they must be able to change shape and position, something that is done with lines (called sheets). Most sails are fastened to solid objects only on one or two sides (occasionally three) but in all cases those solid objects can flex or change position relative to each other. For example the mainsail of a normal single-masted sailboat is attached to the mast at the front, and the boom at the bottom. The boom is pivoted where it attaches to the mast, and also the attachment point can be moved up and down the mast, and the sail can slide up and down the mast and along the boom.. This absorbs strain due to changes in wind pressure (as well as allowing control of the sail shape), and is more than enough to cope with any changes in size due to shrinkage.",more than enough to cope with any changes in size,0.115213104,820,869,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19182

This alarm pheromone smells like bananas. If you are unfortunate enough to be stung, you may wish to leave the area as you tend to the sting, because alarm pheromones are being received by other bees. From the Mandibular glands: This consists of 2-heptanone and is used as an anaesthetic and to paralyze intruders, after which bees remove the intruder from the hive.

222,,How can one find the difficult to find geocaches?,practice,"Read the cache page closely. There may be hints in other places as well as the obvious encrypted hint - the cache description, title, and previous logs may all pose clues that would help you on your search. I tend to try without first but if I'm really stuck I'll read all I can to try and give me a bit more of an idea. Bear in mind that the co-ordinates are often only rough. I've found a couple of caches where the co-ordinates have been 60m off! Bear in mind that you'll have the inaccuracy of the original person who grabbed the co-ordinates as well as the same of your own GPS, so in places with poor coverage it could be wildly out. If the place your GPS guides you to doesn't make sense, don't necessarily stick to that one spot, walk around, but... Don't scout randomly, use a methodical route. All too often people make the mistakes of walking around randomly and coming back to the same couple of places, missing the more subtle place that they would have found otherwise... I tend to check the obvious places first and then cover the area more thoroughly. Look up. People often look down and all around them for clues, but I've seen people really struggle to find caches in plain sight if they're above head height! Equally, look up for clues as well - I hid a cache with the clue ""underneath 3 cables"" (those cables being cables in plain sight running about 20 foot in the air) and you'd be surprised how many people looked for ages because they didn't get the clue! Bounce ideas off someone else. If you don't understand the clue, ask someone else if they have any ideas. Sometimes something you've been pondering over for hours can jump out near instantly to someone else! One particular clue was ""CND"", and the cache site was a few fence posts roughly in the shape of the corresponding flag. Being too young, I had no idea what ""CND"" meant at all - my parents were right on it however! Remember that caches can be all sorts of objects. They're not always just the obvious tin - I easily found one recently that was a (toy) frog, and many people had missed it on the assumption that just couldn't be it. Know when to give up. Seriously, if you can't find it having searched around for a couple of hours and the previous 6 logs were all DNFs (did not find), there's a very good chance it's no longer there. Leave a note and ask the cache owner to have a look if they aren't already. Remember to mark a waypoint for your car . Not strictly to do with finding them, but especially if it's a cache that involves wandering around and you're not exactly sure where you are, mark a waypoint for where you started / parked / know where you are. Takes all of 2 seconds and could save you wandering around lost for hours. Overall though the best way to find them is practice - the more you end up finding the better you'll get at it and the more spots you'll notice that you wouldn't have otherwise.

265,,How can I signal for help in the wilderness?,Signal rocket,"It depends a little bit on where you want to signal emergency. But I think you're talking about remote areas. In these areas, searches are most often made by aircrafts. That's why it is necessary that you're seen from above and from far away. So you have a couple of possibilities dependening on your equipement. There is also an Wikipedia article that explains the Alpine distress signal. Bright clothing: This is especially useful if you're in open terrain and if you don't have any other equipment to signalize an emergency. But with bright clothing it is easier to locate you compared to black/white or grey clothing. So you should enhance your chances and wear yellow, red or orange clothing. Flashlights: You can use your headlamp or a flashlight to signal the place where you're located. You could for example use the morse alphabet to signal SOS (3 short, 3 long, 3 short) or the international distress signal (6 flashes within a minute, 1 minute pause, 6 flashes within a minute, ...). Whistles: In the same way you use a flashlight, you can use a whistle. A whistle is a very small and light item, so I would recommend to always take it with you if you're going on a serious trip. The big advantage compared to the flashlight is, that you can hear the sound during daylight or in thick fog, when the flashligts can't be recognized. Fire: If you have something to make a fire, use it to mark your location. If possible, build a fire triangle. This is also an international distress signal. Signal rocket: A very useful way to show that you need help. The big advantage is that signal rockets can fly up to 300 or 400 meters so that they are widely visible. The explosion of a signal rocket also leads to an easily recognizable pattern on a radar. The problem is that signal rockets aren't things that are part of a standard euqipment and in some countries it is not so easy to buy one.

Even having a book with pictures of edible berries can be tricky as some poisonous ones are disguised as their edible counterparts. Plants, on the other hand, should not be edible if the sap is milky. Milky sap often means poison. Take, for instance, Euphorbia which can look like cacti and trick you. So check the sap. With insects it's easier.

347,,How can I rescue someone lost in an avalanche?,try to remain calm - hopefully your partners have practised rescue techniques,"First - Assess the situation and determine if an active rescue is possible and safe. Many would-be rescuers are caught or killed in follow up avalanches because they acted without assessing the surrounding conditions. Assuming you have equipment to assist in the rescue follow the guidelines below. Yell to alert your partners and other people that may be in the area. Watch the victim! Memorize the last seen point. Make sure it is safe to search. Don't become a victim yourself. Designate a leader and quickly develop a search plan. Look for surface clues like gloves, boots, and other equipment. Conduct a beacon search. Get close and probe BEFORE you dig. The best practice for minimum equipment to take to the backcountry with you are: Avalanche beacon (that you know how to use) Rescue shovel Avalanche probe Extra clothing If you are the person caught in the avalanche the following actions could help save your life. From the Forest Service National Avalanche Center Try to ski or board off the slab by maintaining momentum and angling to edge of slide like the very lucky people in video above do. Simultaneously, if you are wearing an Avalung, get it in your mouth If you get knocked down and you have an Air Bag System deploy it. Discard poles (never ski in the backcountry with your pole straps on). Hopefully you have releasable bindings and your skis or board come off; if they do, roll on to your back with your feet downhill. Swim hard upstream to try to get to the rear of the avalanche. Dig into the bed surface to slow you down and let as much debris as possible go past. Grab a tree if you can FIGHT! As the avalanche slows, try to thrust your hand or some part of your body above the surface and then stick a hand in front of your face to make an air space around your mouth. If completely buried, try to remain calm - hopefully your partners have practised rescue techniques and they will quickly find you.

Place waterproof tarp outside tent Good for rain conditions or where rocks and debris can damage the tent floor. Purchase a good quality waterproof tarp slightly larger than tent footprint dimensions. When setting up the tent Fold edges into the wall dimensions (folded edge under not over the tarp.) Make sure no edges extend beyond the rain fly Place rain fly on the tent. Stake out the tent as normal. Place waterproof tarp inside tent Good for snow conditions Purchase a good quality waterproof tarp slightly larger than tent footprint dimensions. Set up tent, including rain fly, and stake out. Place tarp in the tent, and fold edges to wall dimensions (fold so that edge is over , not under the tarp) The reason for the difference is that no matter how hard you try, in all but bitter cold conditions you will have some melting of the snow under your tent. This invariably gets onto the tarp surface and makes the tent floor wet, or icy. I have never purchased an aftermarket tent floor, because they are overpriced and can be easily made following the steps above. If you are ambitious you can create a custom floor by cutting, and melting the tarp edges. Then re-grommeting the tarp so that it can be independently staked to the ground.

Either way, an idea would be to use puppy or performance good as they're both higher in caloric value, nutritional content and are easier to digest than regular dog food. The actual amount of food you feed really depends on your dog. How has she handled the shorter hikes? Have you noticed an increase or decrease in appetite during and directly after the hikes? How she responds to the shorter hikes will help indicate how she'll handle the longer, overnight trip. You may want to try out the dog food calculator here: Dog Food Calculator . It's a nice way to compare her current calorie needs to the calculator results then, compare them to the results for increased activity. Depending on how active your dog is now versus how much she'll do on the trail her caloric needs may be just slightly elevated to doubled, which is another good reason to monitor her on the shorter hikes. And, in relation to your question dogs have a carnivorous bias while having an omnivorous ability, meaning they are designed to eat meat but can handle me plant material. Feeding a grain-free diet will help limit the amount of food you will need to carry for her because grain-free food has a greater protein content, is more calorie dense and more easily digestible.

Serrations are not a replacement for a saw. A saw cuts a kerf wider than the blade itself so it (with skill) doesn't jam.

Getting onto technique itself, here are a couple of videos that show how to use a small knife (not a chopper) better than I could in words. If you have a proper fixed-bade you can use batoning which is a very powerful technique, but don't try it with a folder.

I think the important steps are what you do when you go to use it and what you use it for. First when I go to use it I remove the cross wrap completely. I hold it by the loop at the top or bottom. Once the cross wrap is undone I pull the mid section apart and lay it on the ground so it is in a complete circle. I don't touch the other end as much as possible. This is pretty easy when climbing but much harder during other activities. If I know I need some of the other end but will not need to touch it after that (like tying to an anchor or plugging in an extension cord) then I pull the amount I need out that side of the rope and then lay the circle of rope on the ground that side down. I will try to find a video or pics of this. Also, when coiling the rope up, if it's more than 100ft I use the ""Backpackers"" Coil (also know as a ""butterfly"" coil). I did a short Google search and this video came up that explained it exactly how I do it.

You'll generally cause much less damage by sticking to an already-eroded path than trudging elsewhere. There's no real hard and fast rule of course and some people's strategies may differ.

I highly doubt you need to be so careful as to keep it on an entirely different side of your rucksack or anything like that.

3467,,How can you make a MSR WhisperLite stove simmer?,elevate the pot higher over the fire,"The short answer: don't. Edit: Instead of simmering on the stove, remove the pot from the flame and keep it insulated to retain heat. See @KateGregory's excellent answer for more details. The long answer: you can reduce the pressure in the fuel bottle, and this will reduce the flow rate of the fuel. This is done by pumping fewer times! The exact number will vary over bottle size and amount of air in it--how full it is. After you brought your pot to a boil, using the stove at regular pressure as per the manual, remove the pot from the stove and turn off the gas valve. Once the stove is off, take a hold of the bottle, hold it up vertically, and carefully unscrew the pump to release the pressure. Do this carefully, and be sure there is no flame immediately nearby, because if the fuel vapour lights up, you are going to have a very bad time. Once the pressure is released, re-seal the pump on the bottle, give it one or two pumps, open the fuel valve and relight the stove. If your flame is still too strong, repeat this procedure with fewer pumps. Ultimately, it's the pressure in the fuel bottle that determines the flow to the stove. The vapour coming out as you depressurize the fuel bottle can catch fire if you are not careful. You must be sure there are no fire sources nearby that will light it! Given the risk involved, I think it's best to avoid doing this. I have been able to make fancy rice, soup, sauce, eggs, pancakes, and other types of meals that benefit from simmering on this stove with regular operation. An easy solution is to simply elevate the pot higher over the fire. If you know you will be in a setting that calls for long-term simmering, then an LPG stove will do a much better job of it.

You start feeling discomfort, then a little pain, then you stop feeling them and forget about them, then you get them amputated. So you should constantly check if you can still feel toes and fingers , and if not, start to warm them up. Second, I find most effective and easy the following method of heating: To warm up toes, swing your leg back-and-forward 30-50 times . The movement is done with the whole leg (including the thigh), as wide as possible, and it should be powerful. To warm up your fingers, make similar motion with your arms, except that you can go 360-degree. Remember to make your full 30-50 swings before saying ""blah, it's not working"";) What happens is you warm blood is driven by centripetal force to flow to the extreme parts of your legs/arms: toes and fingers. Normally they don't get much blood in cold conditions, because your body regulation mechanisms try to keep more warmth at the center of the body by thinning peripherial vessels (it's an overreaction). If you weren't feeling your fingers/toes before starting this, warming up might be very painful. So it's better to do 20, small pause to let heat reach frozen tissues, a little screaming, another 20;) Note: if you weren't feeling your toes or fingers for a long time, things may have gone beyond simple treatment. I'm not sure this method is advised in such situation, because it provides fast heating, and all recommendations for treating serious frostbites prescribe slow heating (also see this question about frostbites ).",make similar motion with your arms,0.116888203,599,633,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3839

4094,,How tight should the line be kept for toproping?,keep him tight,"Like with most climbing related questions, I personally find it hard to give a definitive rule that applies to all circumstances. There are a couple of safety factors to consider, as well as the perception of the climber. Don't venture out on your own if any of the following doesn't seem intuitive to you. Keep in mind the following: Rope stretch: Rope stretch is a combination of the climber's weight, the amount of slack given, the steepness of the climb, the dynamic properties of the rope, and how much rope is out. For example: A heavy climber at the bottom of a long, steep route with a dynamic rope and plenty of slack means there is going to be a lot of rope stretch. If you are not very experienced at belaying a climber on top-rope, a good exercise for both you the belayer and the climber is to approximate the maximum amount of rope stretch for that climber on that specific route before he/she begins to climb: Have him/her sit in his/her harness and observe how far the rope stretches. Factor in some additional distance if you are giving a lot of slack. Obstacles on the route: If the climber falls and weights the rope, are there any obstacles he or she might hit. Obstacles on a route might be a ledge below, a wall to the side, or the top of a roof if the climber has climbed above one. This is not a definitive list of all possible obstacles you might encounter while climbing. How experienced is the climber: An experienced lead climber most likely knows how to take a long fall and will react appropriately to obstacles on the way down. A novice climber on the other hand might even have trouble sitting in his/her harness without awkwardly swinging into the wall. Don't assume, ask! If all of the above is taken into consideration and the anchor is bomber, it is perfectly fine to give a climber several feet of slack, if and only if he/she is asking for it. My rule of thumb boils down to: Give the climber what she needs . Most of the time this means, if he wants to be kept tight, keep him tight, if she wants slack, giver her some slack. Sometimes giving the climber what he/she needs means ignoring what he/she sais, and doing what is safest: A cocky climber might want more slack just off of a ledge. An inexperienced climber might want to be kept tight after just having cleared a roof with a lot of rope out, which could result in injury when the feet don't have anything to push against but when the first body-part that does is the face when it hits the top of the roof (it might be best to altogether avoid situations like the latter with inexperienced climbers.) As a closing remark: Make sure there is at least one experienced climber at the craig setting up the top-rope and overseeing the belaying. That way, if the climber is asking for slack because he/she is getting pulled off the rock and the belayer is unsure if that is a safe thing to do there is someone to address the situation. Some situations might even warrant a spotter, if there is a lot of rope stretch and an uneven landing.",keep him tight,0.252536088,2007,2021,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4094

4712,,How does cam strength change with the retraction angle?,direction of pull changes slightly,"Under-camming and camming angle are two very different things. The camming angle is constant for the whole range of the cam and is defined by the shape of the cam-lobe and can range from 12.5 degrees to up to 21 degrees (Black Diamond's C4s for example have a camming angle of 14.5 degrees.) An undercammed cam has the same holding strength as a cam in its sweet-spot. The problem with undercamming is stability of the placement. An undercammed cam is likely to walk out of the crack with little tugs from the rope as the leader moves past the placement, and it will pull out when the direction of pull changes slightly. A good cam placement will not walk and can adjust to angle of pull. If the only possible placement is an undercammed camming device, extending the placement with a sling can prevent the piece from walking out, but proceed with caution! To answer your question: An undercammed cam has the full holding strength the cam is rated to.

The gelcoat is the hard outer waterproof layer which covers the fiberglass. In this case you need some Gelcoat filler or similar. Follow the instructions, clean and sand the surround area and apply the filler. The large hole will require a bit more work. You'll probably need to make the hole bigger and cut out the surrounding damaged area, sand around it before cutting some glass fibre roll to size (a bit bigger than your new hole). Then apply a resin, either a polyester resin and finish with gelcoat when dry or expoy and no gelcoat (I would probably use expoy, doesn't look as nice but is stronger).

6394,,How to arrange 2 Prusiks when ascending a rope?,know a way,"In case of ascending on a rockface it does not really matter which way round you use it. I put the chest-prusik above the foot-prusik, but this is only because of personal taste. By adjusting the lengths of the slings you can do huge steps in this configuration too. Even though this may not be desirable, as shorter steps can be more efficient (also up to personal taste, try it, find what suits you best). In case of self rescue out of a crevasse, this is different. The main problem here is getting over the edge, where the rope has most likely cut into the snow/ice. To get over it you have to bring your foot-prusik as high as possible. Put the foot-prusik above the chest-prusik. Then get as high as possible until the prusik is stuck because of the snow. Then try to get the rope loose by pushing away from the side of the crevasse to get the foot-prusik higher. Then step into it, get the chest-prusik higher. Repeat until you can get over the edge. In reality I do not think this will be needed very often, as may have crampons and/or axes to help you ascend or in most cases your partner can help you get out. But for the worst case scenario its always well to know a way.

In backpacking lighter often means less durable which is generally true for cuben fiber as well. A cuben fiber backpack will probably hold for 2000 miles (e.g, a thru-hike) but not much more. For this reason, there is now a hybrid cuben/nylon material which is a bit heavier (2.92 oz/sqyd) and more durable. It can definitely be expensive if you use it everyday for long hikes. Cuben fiber resists puncture and tearing relatively well . Not so much with abrasion and folding. I have a rock sack (for bear bagging) made of cuben and it is heavily beaten up. Cuben fiber is less durable than sil-nylon in my experience. It also depends on the application (tent, stuff sack, pack, etc.). Once damaged, it is easy to apply duct tape to it for field repair. You can also use cuben fiber patches . Edit: From ZPack FAQ backpack section: Should I go with the normal 1.43 oz/sqyd Cuben Fiber Material or the heavier 2.92 oz/sqyd Hybrid material?

Many people including Joe and Sheryl have completed thru-hikes with our newer Hybrid material backpacks. Those packs held up much better and were still in good condition at the end.

7969,,How to attach signs to trees considering tree growth?,lag bolts,"Given that trees don't push outward, one option is to use lag bolts, and once a year two go around and turn them out a little bit so they are never engulfed in the growth. The amount of turning you'll need to do and the frequency will depend on the speed of growth and how secure you need the sign. If you can leave a half-inch out of the tree and have the sign hang on it, as you are currently doing with nails, and if they are slow growing trees, you may only need to turn them every few years. Fast trees with no bolt head gap may need to be loosened twice a year or more. While the signs are light a thicker lag bolt than necessary should be considered so you can exert the force required to loosen it after the tree re-seals the damage caused by it and makes it much harder to turn initially. There are a lot of resources about fixing items to trees in the tree house communities and businesses on the internet. There you can find out more about how trees grow with items attached . There are situations where a tree will exert apparent pressure on items affixed to the outside, but the issue is that the pressure isn't great enough to overcome the friction of the fastener into the heartwood. Most accounts suggest that if small nails are used on large flat boards, some trees will push the board away, pulling the fasteners through. Otherwise the board is engulfed as well, becoming part of the tree (and a vector for disease and damage) Treehouses are usually built using lag bolts with several inches of space between the tree and the board attached to the lag bolt. Once the tree grows to the board, the tree house must be adjusted to move the board away from the tree again, and the lag bolt loosened or re-positioned depending on the tree house redesign.

8723,,How did cartographers map out shores before modern times?,dead reckoning,"The topics of navigation and cartography are two sides of the same coin, and there are entire books written about each. It is interesting to study the history of cartography because it very graphically shows the corresponding improvements in navigation over time. In order to make an accurate map, you need to know first where you are making your observations from. Making the observations from a previously known position will result in much greater accuracy. This position may have been established by an earlier survey (eg, working from a known point on an existing map) or by being able to independently figure out your position with good certainty on the position of the globe. Prior to the mid-1700's, the primary means of navigation was dead reckoning (DR). This requires that you iteratively advance your position on the map from your last known position using direction and time/distance. Of course, over time, errors will compound resulting in reduced accuracy. You must have a way of measuring your direction of travel and a (somewhat) accurate value for your speed. Later in the 1700's, it was possible to navigate more accurately using celestial navigation. This allowed a skilled navigator to determine his position rather accurately (typically within a few miles) at any point on the globe. The position was typically found once each day and advanced using DR as necessary. Today, we have GPS. Measuring distance north and south is considerably more easy than measuring distance east and west. Lines of latitude are evenly spaced, where lines of longitude are not. In the northern hemisphere, latitude can be measured by finding the elevation of Polaris above the horizon. Conversely, lines of longitude converge at the poles resulting in variable distance. Measuring longitude is very tricky, though there is a great book called ""Longitude"" (Dava Sobel) which covers the topic (and its solution) exceptionally well. You will note in many older maps, distances north and south are quite accurate where distances east and west are often distorted. To your immediate concern - mapping a shoreline - I would recommend using a GPS receiver (modern equivalent of celestial navigation) to record your position at the moment you are making your observations. In making your observations, use a cruiser compass, which allows you to shoot relatively accurate bearings from your position. Record the bearings to several reference points over a couple of observations, and you will be able to triangulate them accurately on paper. From these triangulated points, you will have to interpolate the coastline between the points. I did a lot of navigation in the Navy, and this technique is the converse of what is known as ""piloting"". With piloting, you are determining your location using bearings from reference points on accurate maps. Here, we are using the bearing to objects to determine position of points along the coastline. Still, it works much the same way. Maps - especially of shorelines - were almost certainly made from observations taken from boats. Naval navigation is much more accurate than navigation on land (especially without good maps!). You give a nod to the problem of dead reckoning in your question regarding the determination of speed. I don't kayak, but I do hike, and I have found that over time, things average out. I can't say what my hiking speed is at any instant, but I can say that I average about 2.8 miles per hour over the course of several hours. If you are interested in this topic, I'd recommend you pick up a copy of Dutton's Navigation and Piloting. This is a text book used to teach navigators, and is perhaps the authority on the topic. The older versions (older than mid-1980s) are especially interesting since they still include some information on celestial navigation. My copy is from 1969. I'd also recommend Barefoot Navigator (Jack Lagan) which covers the navigation skills of the ""ancient"" cultures. ""Finding Your Way Without Map and Compass"" (Harold Gatty) is another fine book. The author was a navigator (both naval and aviator), so he has some interesting takes on navigation.

Good: Forests (unless in an actual storm with very high wind speeds), valley ground (keep away from streams and rivers, they might suddenly swell!) Passable: near cliff bottoms (make sure you're not endangered by rocks coming loose above you during the rain), taking shelter next to boulders, in trenches or other depressions in the terrain.

Reading an answer on SE is not going to be enough. You need to practice. The following is just an outline. There is an entire chapter in Freedom of the Hills on glacier travel and crevasse rescue. The first step is always going to be to construct an anchor so that the team can get out of arrest position. If the leader is the one who's fallen in, then the person at the opposite end of the rope would normally be the one who gets up and builds an anchor, while other team member(s) stay in arrest position. You build the anchor between the lip of the crevasse and the nearest person, so that everyone has tension released from the rope and can stand up. While doing this, you want to make sure not to create more victims, so e.g., the person building the anchor needs to be on a Prusik. Now talk to the climber and discuss the situation. You want to know if they're hurt. If possible, you can try to prepare the lip of the crevasse so that the rope doesn't become entrenched. For example you can see if you can get an ice ax or a pack under it. This will be easier if the victim is able to get to a stance and unweight the rope. In most cases, it is not possible to keep the climbing rope from becoming completely entrenched. If you have enough extra line, you may want to prepare a separate portion of the lip and throw down a separate rescue line. After this, you do not immediately start hauling the victim out. That's a last resort, and often it doesn't work. The following are various options to consider, roughly in order. See if the victim can climb out under their own power, while belayed from above. There may be an easy way to walk out of the crevasse at the bottom. If so, then you could lower the victim. If the victim isn't hurt, he should be able to Prusik up the rope. Getting over the lip may be physically difficult, especially if the rope is entrenched. It may be helpful if there are two ice tools that the victim can use. As a last resort, such as in situations where the victim is unconscious or so badly injured that he can't Prusik up, consider trying to set up a pulley system and hauling him out. This may or may not work. If the rope is entrenched, you can't just haul the victim over the lip -- people have been killed that way.",pulley system,0.14418593,2202,2215,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10323

It won't normally evaporate at this rate, as the humidity will quickly raise to 100%, however, in the first tens of minutes, the moisture will be sucking the heat out of you body at the same rate you produce it - you will become colder.

Birds naturally flock (in the air or on the ground ) as a defensive mechanism against predators, etc. Though complex there appears to be some basic rules to the mechanism as a whole: Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules: Separation - avoid crowding neighbors (short range repulsion) Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbors Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbors (long range attraction) With these three simple rules, the flock moves in an extremely realistic way, creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise.

So in your example: The ""sentinals"" would react to the perceived threat and move/react, their neighbours would react to this movement and then the following neighbours would then react, etc, etc until the whole flock reacted as a whole.",react to the perceived threat,0.076674305,947,976,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10921

11508,,How to treat a severe allergic reaction while hiking?,maintaining a clear airway,"Anybody who has severe allergies which could lead to anaphylaxic shock should carry appropriate medication with them. Typically, that would consist of: An antihistamine (e.g. benadryll) An epinephrine auto-injector (aka ""Epi-Pen"") Benadryll is available over the counter and you should have it in your first aid kit. Epi is by prescription only (at least in the US), so the individual who has allergies should carry their own. If you're leading a large group, you may be able to get a prescription and standing orders for trained staff to carry and administer epinephrine to group members. Many people think that just injecting epi when somebody has an anaphylactic attack is the entire treatment. It's important to know that epinephrine does not fix the underlying issue! It only helps to reduce swelling, helping to re-open the airway. You must fix the cause of the reaction! As soon as an exposure to a known allergen occures ‚Äì even if the person isn't having a visible reaction ‚Äì you need to immediately have the person take an antihistamine. Antihistamines are drugs that suppress the histamine response, i.e. the body's overreaction to an antigen. This is what actually reduces the severity of the allergic reaction itself. Correct dosage depends on the person; consult the instructions on the antihistamines or talk to a doctor. The important consideration with an allergic reaction is maintaining a clear airway. If you get the antihistamines into the patient immediately, it's possible that the reaction will be contained and the patient will not develop anaphylaxis. In the event that they do develop anaphylaxis, that's where you need to monitor their airway and administer epi if necessary. If the patient is having difficulty breathing, encourage them to take deep, calm breaths, and to pace their breathing off yours. If the patient is unable to maintain a clear airway, be prepared to administer epinephrine. Epi-pen trainer kits are widely available through first aid training programs, so if you expect to be traveling in the wilderness with people who may require epi, you should do the training. The auto-injectors have clear instructions on them; typically you just remove the blue cap, place the orange end of the auto-injector on their thigh, push down hard on the epi-pen to trigger the injector, and hold it in place for at least 30 seconds. The epi is administered automatically at the correct dosage. Make sure to carefully follow the directions as individual auto-injectors may vary in how exactly they are administered. Epi wears off after 10-15 minutes, so most people will carry either a dual-injector or two injectors, so that a second dose can be administered if necessary. When injecting, always hold the injector gripped in your fist, do not place anything over either end of the pen to ensure you don't accidentally inject it into yourself! Make sure to monitor the patient's vital signs throughout, and continue to monitor their condition after the initial treatment. Ensure that any secondary issues such as bleeding from a bite, etc. are taken care of as well. Once you've stabilized the patient, you need to start planning for an evacuation. Anaphylactic reactions are life threatening. If you are in a very remote area and have access to an emergency locator beacon or other outside communication, it's appropriate to request emergency assistance. As always, the most important thing is to be adequately prepared. Understanding the allergies (and other medical concerns) your group members have, what treatment options they have, and how to use them is critical. You should know all of this information for every member of your party before heading into the wilderness, so that if an emergency situation does arise you're already prepared. Most people with medical concerns which could require your immediate intervention will be happy to show you how to handle it should they need your help. In this particular example, epi injectors differ in appearance and operation, and knowing exactly how to use the injectors belonging to members of your party will save you precious time should you actually need to use them.

13422,,How to get prepared for Fj√§llr√§ven Classic hiking tour?,tightening/loosening some straps,"Body If you're already moderately in shape (i.e. able to do some proper hikes of 20km with 10kg weight as you say) I don't think you'll have to to any specific training per se... But of course training always helps: For my first longer treks (200-300km, 2-3 weeks) I did some three to four 20km training hikes with a 15-20 kg pack each. For someone unaccustomed to hiking (not in your case), I'd suggest starting with 15-20km hikes without weight, then gradually increase it until max pack weight is achieved (maybe over a total of 10 hikes). This really mostly serves to make sure your joints and sinews are used to being used and can bear the load - you'll likely not build up muscles this way unless you do a lot more training. Note: Carrying 20kg for hours is not pleasant at first: expect some pain, some soreness, etc. Over the first couple of days the unpleasantness normally recedes (also your pack'll get lighter as you consume food and fuel). Until then I suggest playing around with all the fitting options of your pack: tightening/loosening some straps, moving the weight closer/further away from your back, changing distribution of weight between shoulders and hip, etc.* Gear Just as important as training your body is making sure that you have the right gear, which fits you properly and is comfortable on long 20kg-pack treks. Most important: Shoes Make sure you have proper hiking boots, which fit you well, and which are well worn in . If you expect to carry a load of 20kg I'd also suggest using higher/heavier boots which also support your ankles, and which often have a stiffer, sturdier sole. (Some people trek with super light footwear, but unless you're quite experienced doing so I'd suggest wearing 'old-school' proper hiking boots.) If you get blisters, deal with the issue before your trek: changing footwear, hardening your feet by doing more training hikes, or bringing blister patches can all work - this depends on your preference, your means, your resources, etc. Backpack The backpack needs to fit well and needs to be properly fitted to your body. I suggest doing some training hikes with full weight (just pack in 20kgs of weigt, e.g. water bottles) to see if the backpack works for you with heavier loads. If your new backpack gets damaged at all during those hikes bring it back to the store and demand a refund for the crappy gear they sold you (happened to a friend twice). On a 100km+ hike you must be able to depend on you pack: failure is not an option, so it must be able to take some punishment. General I suggest to take advantage of your training hikes to familiarize yourself with all of your important gear and to make sure everything works the way you planned it to. E.g. cooking on your stove, putting up/taking down your tent, organizing your pack, etc. Also the training hikes will let you get a first experience on how much food, fuel, water and other necessities (toilet paper, soap, sun blocker, ...) you'll need - allowing you to only bring to your final trek what you'll actually need. Fun fact: the route you linkd in the question above was actually part of my first proper trek.

13812,,"How can I tell which way is ""down wind""",Using my ears,"Use your ears. OK, Let me explain that. But first things first. The direction of the wind is what we call ‚Äúdownwind‚Äù. If I throw a handful of white flour into the wind, the direction that flour travels is ‚Äúdownwind‚Äù. The breeze picks up the scent of nearly everything it touches and carries that scent along wherever it goes. Like the white flour, but on a scale so small that you can‚Äôt see it, the smell of nearly everything on your person and in your camp is picked up and carried on the wind. Any animal passing downwind from your camp then knows everything that is in your camp, just by smell (if its sniffer is sensitive enough ‚Äì and a bear‚Äôs is). So, you are exactly right. Store your food at least 100 feet downwind from your camp. If a bear is attracted to your camp, he will most likely be tempted by your food, so keeping it far from you will help keep you safe. Hopefully, the canister will do its job and keep your food safe. Generally, the wind blows different directions throughout the day, because of terrain and changes in temperature. At night, temperatures even out and cool and air movements usually settle down, becoming slow and steady (no hot, moving sun in the sky to heat up the air). Therefore, if you don‚Äôt know the prevailing night-time wind directions in your area, it would be best to check the direction of air movement after the sun goes down (assuming there are no storms stirring things up). As air cools, it sinks, flowing downhill. If you are backpacking in hilly or mountainous areas, rest assured that the breeze will be blowing downhill during the night (unless there is a storm). If one is near the ocean (I know, you stated that you are inland), then the wind should blow out to sea when the sun is down (I live far, far inland, so I have not experienced this, but that‚Äôs what I was taught in school). Here is the best way that I have found to discover the direction of the breeze near my camp (Using my ears): Wait until dusk, that calming, shadowy time between sundown and full dark. Walk in a wide circle around your camp (20-30 feet out will do), stopping several times to test the direction of the air currents. To test the direction of the air currents, simply uncover your head, face and neck, and turn slowly. The fine hairs on your cheeks, and especially your ears, can feel the breeze (even a very soft breeze). When you feel the breeze blowing across the fine hairs on your cheeks and both ears, stop. You are facing UPwind. DOWNwind is directly behind you. Sampling the wind like this in a circle around your camp helps you make a very confident assessment of the wind‚Äôs direction. If the breeze is gentle and erratic, you may have to make a couple circles, and even then, you may have to guess a little. However, it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt get it exactly right, as long as you place/hang your food far from camp. The goal is to place your food in such a way that it does not lure a bear into your camp.",Using my ears,0.143398076,1935,1948,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13812

Then I stare at the spot, and mount the shotgun. Without moving, I shift my focus to the bead and see how close the bead is to my intended target. You can do a similar process by closing your eyes and mounting the shotgun. Open your eyes and see where you are looking first, then check how close the shotgun is in alignment to where you are looking. If you do this procedure with one shotgun, you can't tell much, but if you do it with two or three, you will find that one is probably coming up very well aligned and one is coming up way off. I have shot the guns that come up naturally much better than I have guns that don't. I also am primarily hunting live birds, so every shot is from an unmounted start. If you are just doing trap or skeet where you can set your mount very deliberately, this technique might not tell you as much. As a note, once I buy a new shotgun, I use this same drill over and over again to practice the mount and disengaging the safety. I often say the word ""Bang"" instead of pulling the trigger, then I check the bead alignment visually.

13996,,"How do you get back in canoe, by yourself?",Use a stirrup you hang at the gunwales,"There isn't only one method, there are a few. Partially the choice depends on which canoe you have (big and wide, very stable or tippy, or a small solo) and if its calm water or not. What you can do with a big canoe might need some tweaks when it comes to some small solo and a canoe with good secondary stability will be easier to get into. Extra flotation is not always needed, its useful to have for practice but some materials allow the canoe to stay at the surface (my cedar canoe will float even if completely swamped for example). When you flip a canoe air remains trapped underneath so, in that condition, it floats upside-down and you can flip it back up without swamping it completely, also canoes that would sink when swamped often have built-in air chambers at the ends so in some ways its possible to selfrescue without extra flotation. (In the other question you linked you are thinking a lot about extra flotation, it can be an help, mostly because whatever room the flotation bag take is less water to bail out, but is not absolutely necessary in a canoe unless you are in whitewater to not get swamped, and there once you flip you don't want to stay close to the canoe, so no re-entry. The other point is that you cant rely on flotation, you might not always have it in the canoe. I don't use extra flotation unless I will encounter rapids, in normal canoe camping trips I used it only once and one of the bags developed a leak so was useless. If you learn to re-enter on your own without any other aid then having extra flotation is just more safety) Its not a great idea to re-enter a semiswamped canoe and start bailing, the idea is that the gunnels are lower on the water so the re-entry should be easier but I find it leads to an almost completely swamped canoe which can capsize on you again and, if you make it in and there are waves, you keep getting in more water than you can bail out. The first thing to do is to flip the canoe upright: from underneath, lift one side first to break the vacuum and then lift and throw it at your side, its the Capistrano flip (easier than what you would think even with heavy canoes and it doesn't leave a lot of water in the hull), or you could roll it upright and start bailing while floating beside the canoe. With two people you would re-enter towards the middle, one person on each side of the canoe, one stabilizes the hull while the other climbs in, first from the water then from inside, or both climb in at the same time thus balancing the hull. When alone some hull shapes will let you climb in from the middle but usually its best to re-enter a bit towards the ends so that your weight on the gunnels will be closer to the centerline. The movement is one smooth motion, grabbing the gunnels with the hands, you want to put your chest inside the boat and then the feet, then its all a matter of rolling on your back and do whatever you need to do. These two youtube videos show you how its done: How to Empty a Swamped Canoe from the Water - Capistrano Flip Capistrano Flip, Canoe solo self rescue Someone teaches to float horizontally at the surface and hook the gunwale with one foot and one arm, the intent is to ""lift and roll"" into the canoe, this never worked for me though. Other methods: Use a stirrup you hang at the gunwales to help pulling yourself in, I used it once during practice and it works but it always gave me a bad feeling (like if my foot could get trapped in the stirrup if I didn't make it in). It is however useful if there was an injury (like a shoulder injury received while bracing improperly before capsizing), to use the stirrup its more like kicking back rather than stepping up, the mental image is to pull the canoe under you with your foot and not to climb onboard like it was a ladder on a dock (or you would end with the feet under the canoe capsizing it again). Use a paddlefloat like the ones used for kayaks, the paddlefloat can be an extra item in the boat or made using a spare, or one's own, lifejacket. I find it laborious and its an extra item to look after, besides it wouldn't work if the paddles are gone when you flipped over. And using your own lifejacket works when everything goes according to plan but if you fall back in trying to re-enter you wont have a lifejacket on use the cargo, if you have packs, in the water to stabilize the hull either as float on one side or as counterbalance on the other depending on the situation or, if the pack is heavy and you wouldn't be able to pull it back in afterwards then use it as counterbalance inside the canoe All in all re-entering the canoe is not that difficult. Its like picking up an heavy cedar-canvas and rolling it up on your shoulders for portaging: it just requires practice. My cedar canoe is 18ft, narrow, tippy and rather heavy (north of 70#) and we did practice re-entries solo, two people and even two people plus packs and a dog. What seemed really difficult at first has gotten easy with practice. The Capistrano was easier than what I thought from the beginning even when solo and packed, its more technique than strength (and you need to break the suction first otherwise you wont lift even a light canoe). Videos and explanations aside its one of those things that benefit from having someone teaching you, it fixes mistakes right away and you wont take days to learn. Here there are another couple videos from youtube: Deep water canoe entry Open Canoe Recoveries PS: flotation bags inside the canoe wont help you to not flip it, if you don't know how to get in in first place you risk flipping it again, remember that you don't have any secondary stability to count on in a swamped canoe. If the weather is bad and there are a lot of good waves it can become a very long and tiring bailing fight. Its not a good situation to be in. Also, somewhere on the net there was (or still is, not sure) a well known webpage promoting inflatable sponsoons outside the canoe, those differ greatly from the narrow and long ""sausage"" sponsoons you see in some touring canoes or the builtin sponsoons of the old cedar canoes, they work against you when you have to flip the canoe upright and in waves they can lead to capsizing again. PSPS: if the selfrescue is going well, you are in the water with waves and wind but the canoe is not swamped anymore and you learned how to get in, sometimes an useful thing is to go upwind at one end of the canoe and lower that end in the water using your weight. The other end will lift and the hull will slowly windvane. You can use that to avoid having waves hitting you broadside (If you decide to swim the canoe to shore instead put the hull in between you and the wind/waves)",Use a stirrup you hang at the gunwales,0.178097889,3267,3305,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13996

Off piste / powder / park : a smaller stack height is generally seen as beneficial. Being closer to the ski provides more stability over uneven terrain (imagine trying to ski wearing stilts).

Those who dislike Gore-Tex boots find that: Under heavy use the membrane degrades and fails, often within weeks. Breathability is compromised and sweat builds up inside the boot. Your feet can sweat over half a pint (280ml) per day so for many this is a significant issue If the boot gets wet it takes significantly longer to dry.

The downsides seem to apply with particular force to lightweight boots and shoes - I've met many people on the trail who were less than delighted with their lightweight GT footwear. But if you are using conventional leather boots, it's harder to see what Gore-Tex offers compared to traditional waterproof dressings.

I usually wash my insoles in the washing machine, I've never had a problem doing that. Use some force to beat as much as you can out of the fabric, then shake out anything that fell out inside. Rinse the shoes thoroughly with water. A source of pressure is best so you can run water through the fabric itself. Best is a hose, because then you can run the water both outside to inside and inside to outside. Let them dry thoroughly. Use a fan to speed this up if needed. Leaving them out in the sun or in a heated area to dry isn't recommended as this can damage both the fabric and the other material of the shoes. Once they dry beat them together again. If more stuff comes out, repeat the process. The only downside to this is that your shoes are wet and out of commission until they dry.",Take out the insoles,0.466146111,130,150,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17167

A kiwi coil is an alpine coil you manage and wear while still tied into the end of your rope. Tie in as you normally would while climbing or glacier walking, then coil as much rope as you want around your body.

If you tie it right, you can safely take a fall and all the force will go into your harness as if on the end of the rope. You can keep smaller coils (3-5m) in your hand too, tie a ""magic knot"" (slip knot) to hold in your hand as a handle between your hand coil and your partner, this helps you keep a better grip on the rope and coil, and in the event you need to drop the coil, the slip knot will come undone as soon as the rope goes taught.

20667,,How to recognize an ocean desert from the surface?,by the color of the water,"To some extent, this is mapped out, but the easier way to tell is by the color of the water. Ocean deserts are characterized by less plankton and thus Chlorophyll . Therefore, the water in an ocean desert will be bluer and less green than the water in an area with plenty of nutrients and oxygen and plankton. Since nutrients are the limiting factor in algae growth, the more nutrients the more productivity. First how do we know how much productivity there is? There are several ways of measuring this. First, in general, the higher the productivity in an environment, the greater the abundance of life. So one way of measuring productivity is to quantify the mass of living organisms---say organisms per cubic meter, for example (square meter if you‚Äôre talking about land). Since animals usually move around, this is most effectively done with plants. In the ocean this means counting algae cells. ... A new and easier way of estimating oceanic productivity is by satellite measurement. Satellites can measure ocean color. The greener the surface ocean water, the more algae, therefore the higher the productivity. Thus global maps of productivity such as the one below can be produced. ... So the ocean is more productive in temperate zones. This also explains why the tropics have that pretty clear blue water. There‚Äôs not much life in it! Productivity and Nutrients Over time, areas with less mixing show reduced productivity, less phytoplankton, and so less chlorophyll.

Clean off the cap if it is dirty, and while you're at it, remove the cap and clean and lubricate the screw as well.

Foot blisters from hiking are caused by friction. Toe socks, in my experience, negate 99% of the friction between and around your toes. Diaper rash ointment has two purposes. It repels moisture, and damp feet are the highest friction. It is also ridiculously slick, and doesn't wipe or wash off easily. The slick nature reduces friction, and the durability means it is very likely to last for the entire hike. A lot of powders are sold and used, even baby powder, but in my experience those increase friction once they get damp. Another common product is runner's lube (like Mueller Lube Stick ).

This is why its good to keep an equipment log noting when important stuff like rope that you depend on is used and anything that happens to it.

Each yarn is rated to just over 35 lbs. On most commercial stuff the inner strands are just 2 yarns twisted together. If you are still unsure then get a Force Gauge and test a single section of the rope. Remember though when testing a single section of rope it tells you NOTHING about the rest of the rope, just if that section was up to the standard. It also means that section of the rope should be disposed of because it has been taken up to it's load and probably cannot be safely done again.

Here is a method for leak-finding that can be done at home or in the field: (Note the location: in a crease that is repeatedly stressed, being by the valve. Also note the difference between bubbles from suds and the bubble from the leak.) Fill a squirt bottle, spray bottle, hydration bladder (something with a nozzle to control the flow) with water near to the top. Add several drops of liquid soap (dish detergent works best). Wet your fully inflated sleeping pad with the mixture. Look for bubbles forming to isolate the leak(s). Carefully mark the location of the leak with a needle/pin (you've got to fix the leak anyway) as you will lose it as soon as you rinse the soapy water away. You may try a grease pencil or china marker but not much else will write on a soapy wet surface. (Note that a grease pencil or china marker can leave residue which can impede adhesion of the patch. If you use one of those, make your reference marks outside of the range of where the patch will go. A pin or needle is best.) Rinse the area to be patched of the soapy water.

4360,,How to Tell When Minimal Running Shoes Are Worn Out?,how your run in it,"It's less about the type of shoe, but how your run in it. Minimalist running shoes should not ""wear out"" in the traditional sense since they have little or no padding to compress. Because many are just soles, then running until that sole is gone is perfectly fine. It is important to note that the reason they don't have (or need) that cushion is because ""minimal"" running shoes encourage a more natural style of running (where you use your foot-spread, ankles, and knees with more elasticity to absorb shock). ""Traditional"" shoes with their 3 inches of padding encourage poor running style (straight legged heal strike in front of the body) and thus need the padding to compensate. When the padding goes, you risk injury since your body isn't designed to take that kind of beating. If you run with a more natural gait in traditional shoes, then you don't need to worry about the padding going on them either. As an added bonus, since ""minimal"" or natural styles of running tend to have less abrasive force on the impact (flow along the pavement rather than skid your heel against it) you might notice your soles lasting longer than traditional shoes as well.",how your run in it,0.056718457,38,56,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4360

5190,,How do you keep the inside of your backpack organized?,Use plastic bags,"I have always viewed packing of backpack in terms of: Ease of access. Distribution of weight to prevent unwanted strain. Distribution of weight is a very important aspect that you have to consider while trekking for a longer duration. Ideally, the heavier things should be closer to your body and the lighter ones away from you. The logic being, the center of gravity will shift awkwardly away from your body if the heavier stuff is too far away from your body. Having said that, ease of access is also important. I have learnt over the years that there is no right way to pack to meet all your criteria. One thing that I do to allow for better organisation is: Use plastic bags to compartmentalize your stuff. Usually trekking bags have one big compartment and you are forced to stuff everything into it. Group similar items together and keep them at one place. Eg: All my electronic stuff go into one pouch. All my toiletries go in together into a plastic cover.

5781,,How high to climb before clipping on a sport climb?,waist level,"Petzl does recommend this for the second bolt : Clip the second bolt at waist level; this reduces the amount of rope out and thus helps prevent the climber hitting the ground in case of a fall before making the clip. ( Section F, second panel .) I think that's generally good advice for clipping the second bolt (and sometimes for the third bolt if it's far from the second). For all other bolts, an important thing to remember is that a quality, well-bolted route will have logical stances from which the equipper intended the clip to be made. Bolts are (generally) not uniformly distributed throughout the route, so it's impossible to make blanket statements as to where you should clip from. Climbing past a perfectly good stance to clip from an awkward stance above doesn't make sense, even though it could potentially minimize a few feet of falling. Keep in mind the huge mental boost (for most climbers) of being one foot below a bolt instead of several feet above it. As I've gained more and more experience, I've gotten better and better at judging those ""clipping stances"" from the climb (or even from the ground). This makes the climbing more efficient. The only way to get better at this is to get new pitches of climbing under your belt and recognize when you clipped from an awkward stance where a better stance existed nearby.",waist level,0.647786915,72,83,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5781
6555,,How to find climbing shoes for toe and heel hooks?,downturned shoes,"Here are some features to keep in mind when buying climbing shoes once you're past the beginner phase: Downturned : Most beginner shoes are pretty flat, which are fine for mainly vertical walls. However, as you climb harder stuff on overhanging walls, it's helpful to have downturned shoes for maintaining a hook-like foot shape. This allows you to hook your toes onto small foot holds to keep your body on the wall or rock. Good-fitting Heel Cup : You want to make sure the shoe fits your heel snugly, or else your heel will feel like it's slipping out during heel hooks. This is something you just have to try on at the store, since a lot of people's feet are different. Personally, I've tried on several shoes that were very tight fitting otherwise but had a lot of dead space in the heel, which is undesirable. Rubber covering top of shoe : Make sure the top part of the shoe has rubber covering it to help with toe hooks. Most beginner shoes just have the canvas material on top of the shoe, which makes toe hooks less effective and the shoe can wear out faster. Rubber Type : Not all climbing shoe rubber is the same. Some are harder, some are softer (stickier). Harder rubber is good for edging off of small foot holds, and it's more durable. As an example, the Five Ten Team VXi (pictured below) has the softest, stickiest rubber I've seen and is great for overhanging climbs since it molds to really small footholds well. However, it would not be an ideal shoe for a route with lots of edging. This is probably less of a consideration, though, compared to the other 4 points for most shoes. Sizing : Don't make the mistake of getting the tightest fitting shoe you can fit your feet into at the store. Make sure it at least feels bearable to stand on your toes or on a small ledge in the store. A little discomfort is fine (that will get less over time), but if it's very painful get a larger size. Yes, it would eventually stretch out a little bit, but only if you wear it many times (and experience a lot of pain all those times).",downturned shoes,0.086889498,273,289,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6555
7003,,How to overcome the fear of falling in lead climbing,by sticking it out,"Everyone who climbs suffers from this to some degree, so you need to accept that doing this will make you scared. What didn't work for me I've had very similar issues to the one's your describe over the years. I've tried several techniques to help with this with mixed result. From my personal experience the below didn't work for me (they may for you) Fall training, i.e. taking a fall deliberately to get used to it. This helps with your fall technique but for me it failed to address the issue. I wasn't scared of taking a controlled fall I was scared that I couldn't hold on while clipping, etc. People shouting encouragement/telling me to get on with it This just annoyed me/made me more frustrated than anything, which made me not want to get into that situation even less, which made me more annoyed at them and me, repeat until I end up shouting at them to simply p**s off and storming away from the crag in a terible mood.. :) Putting pressure on myself to succeed Partly as a result of the above I ended up getting into a mindset that I was just being silly and I should just man up and get on with it. again, for me this simply made the matter worse, to the point where the grade I could lead gradually got worse. What did work for me Ok so what did work for me: Coming to terms with it You will get scared, that's fine; don't fight it, just accept it. ""Ok I'm scared, now what"". This helps you think though the panic. Turn your brain on to fight your chemical response Panic/fear is a chemical response to being in a dangerous situation. Your body is flooded with Adrenaline and you go into fight or flight mode. So do you fight or flight? Well neither : you're 10 meters off the ground attached to a rope, neither option is helpful . You have two options, fall (fine you're not bothered by this but ultimately this just releases more adrenaline and makes matters worse) or engage your brain and out-think your chemical response. Start concentrating on what's around you, focus on your breathing, get this under control: you're safe remember that, where's the next really good hold, I need 5 mins to just get myself in order, try not to down climb but if you do, do it slowly and controlled. Stay put/stay calm Try and wait it out. Don't simply let go and don't down climb. Wait, close your eyes, concentrate on your breathing, wait for the adrenaline to die down to an acceptable level, then continue. Try and hold on at this point (as opposed to letting your belayer ""take""), realise you can probably hold at this point longer than you think. Rationalise the situation. Don't freeze Ok, I know I said to stay put (above), but this can only get you so far, at some point you're going to need to do something. So do something. Plan what you're going to do, work out what you're going to hold onto, where you're going to put your feet and then do it slowly and deliberately while breathing though the panic. Again, rationalise the situation. Try to turn the negative into a positive So you get scared when you climb and get swamped with Adrenaline?! Isn't this why your doing this? for the buzz? The Adrenaline! Turn the negative into a positive. Next time you get scared, try and enjoy it! I know this can be hard but adrenaline can be pretty enjoyable if you learn to deal with the fight or flight response. Break the vicious cycle You get frustrated because you're not climbing at your ability which makes your more anxious which makes you push yourself, which makes matters worse, repeat. STOP, go for a boulder, relax, enjoy yourself, the wall's not going anywhere and you can come back whenever you want. Your supposed to be enjoying this! Visualisation This is where you visualise the moves and convince yourself you can do it, etc. I've now started using this more and more. I often find that working though moves in my head, thinking about falling, etc. repeatedly desensitises me. So I now use this technique more than I did at the time of writing. I've also been watching videos of myself and others climbing. It helps to put the actual danger I'm in into perspective. It can seem a long way down when you're up there but if you look at it externally it often occurs (to me anyway) that it's really not as bad as it seems at the time. Repetition The best way to overcome something you're scared of is to keep doing it, in fact do it more. The more you get yourself into scary (but safe) situations the less daunting they seem. There really is no substitute for just getting out there and climbing as often as you can. Start at the point where you feel scared but not too scared. Climb lots of routes at this grade. When it starts to become less scary do a harder route. The above is based on my personal experiences. Different people will react differently to this. You need to find a solution that fits you. A nice story For me the turning point was when I was trad climbing, outdoors. I was leading an easy(ish) pitch but it was harder/more exposed than I'd expected. I found myself balanced on an arete 3-4m above my next placement which (in my head at least) would never hold a fall. I couldn't take a fall here, I had to get my sh*t together or I could hurt myself (in reality I was probably perfectly safe but I'd worked myself into such a state that I felt in real danger). I sat there slowly praying looking for a placement and not finding one, gradually I started to feel better, ""hold on this hold is solid, I could hang here one handed for about a minute easy"" ""Now my legs stopped shaking that foot placement is about the size of my living room"" ""There's a crack there, why the hell couldn't I see that before?, what's that? a number 10"" ""Bloody hell I could hang a mini off of that placement"" It suddenly occurred to me that indoors I would have just let go and become annoyed at myself. But by sticking it out I'd overcome it. I felt awesome at the top and jumped about like an idiot. My girlfriend didn't understand what the fuss was all about, ""That was easy?!"" Whenever I feel like I'm loosing it I try and remember this situation and how focused I felt once I'd gotten control of my emotions.",by sticking it out,0.509385884,5827,5845,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7003
7020,,How to walk as a roped party on a glacier?,Do not walk a glacier with less than 3 persons on a rope,"First of all: Walking a glacier contains some serious risks and roping up is not enough to cover that risks, but also knowledge of crevasse rescue is needed. Therefore I strongly recommend a glacier course where all those things are taught. Now for some basic things to consider when walking a glacier as a roped party: When walking a glacier, one normally does not place any protection where the rope is fixed or runs through, therefore the only thing to hold a fall of a team member into a crevasse are the other team members. The problem is, that the force exceeded by a falling person attached to your harness can easily tear you down, especially if you have not been awaiting it. Therefore the base rules are: Do not walk a glacier with less than 3 persons on a rope. Some people also go as two-person teams but this is only acceptable under very special circumstances (e.g. glacier known to have little to no crevasses, both are very experienced in glacier walking and crevasse rescue...), but it is not recommended. The group size should not exceed 6 to 7 persons, otherwise the whole rope party will get rather slow. Bigger groups should be split into several rope parties. The less people there are in a rope party the more rope should be between them. For a 3 person party, 10 to 12m of rope between them are recommended, for larger groups distances around 8m are OK. Whenever possible, try to walk through the crevasse zone perpendicularly to the crevasses. Walking parallel is quite risky, especially if they are covered with snow, as crevasses can extend under the surface much longer than they appear and may change direction under the snow cover. While walking, do not allow for slack rope between the members. If one is falling into a crevasse and there is slack rope between them and the next member, the falling body is able to gain some momentum before the rope tightens and catches the fall. The more momentum the body already has, the higher is the chance that other team members are carried away and cannot hold the fall. [1] For the same reason, one should keep the rope straight, i.e. do not walk zig-zag lines but as straight as possible. If someone falls while the group is taking some zig-zag path, they will get pulled sideways and have again the possibility to gain some momentum before the others can catch them. If someone needs some slack rope, for example when they have to jump across a crevasse, they shall tell the members in front and behind them about how much slack is needed. If someone has to jump, the other members should be extra prepared for a fall. Keep the rope straight as long as you are in crevasse terrain, also during breaks. Gather only when the rope leader has secured a spot with safe ground and commands the team to come up. Another point to know and be aware of is where it is better to go everyone on their own instead of roped up. Hard-frozen snow, especially hard-frozen firn does provide nearly no friction. That means that if someone falls on a slightly inclined firn surface, they will immediately gain some momentum and if their fall is not stopped immediately, can easily tear away the other members of their rope party. Once this has happened, it is nearly impossible to stop such a sliding rope party as whenever one of them can arrest his fall, the others still falling will tear him away again. The case, that all members are able to arrest at the same time is negligible and will happen only by very rare chance. This is already the case for rather slight inclines of about 25¬∞.[1] Here the doctrine (at least in the German speaking countries) is that the risk of one member stumbling and taking away the whole rope party outweighs the risk of a crevasse fall (crevasses tend to get less frequent as the terrain gets steeper) and therefore it's better to go unroped at that point.

8261,,How effective are pen launcher bear bangers compared to bearspray?,louder,"Bear bangers and bear spray are designed for slightly different situations. Bear bangers are intended to use when a bear is still a ways off, but is showing no signs of leaving, or is wandering towards you. The idea is to scare the bear off before he gets close enough that you need to be seriously worried. They generally shoot a few hundred feet. Looking through online forums, there's some suggestions that they are illegal in at least some National Parks, but I didn't find any specifics. But if you are planning on taking them with you, I'd recommend contacting whoever is in charge of the land you are hiking on, and asking if they are legal. Since they work with an explosive charge, there's also a fire risk (relatively low, but if it's a dry environment, the fire risk will still be high). They are louder than things like bells and shouting, but the principle is the same. Bear spray is for close encounters. By the time the bear is close enough for the spray to be effective, it's obvious that the bear is behaving aggressively. According to http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/BearSpray/bearspray.html , bear spray should be used when the bear is 25 feet away or more, and should be sprayed for at least 6 seconds (enough to deter even a determined bear). Most of the sprays I read about claimed to shoot 30-35 feet. I'd guess that distance is in ideal conditions- warm, no wind. Bear spray is intended as a last resort, once its clear that noise is not making the bear back off. In short, bear bangers are meant to work as a deterrent, much like bells or shouting. Bear spray is meant as a defense, for use once you are already in trouble, and the bear is clearly behaving aggressively and is close. Edit: A note on bells, since their effectiveness is being questioned in the comments. A quick internet search shows that their effectiveness is low, and probably varies geographically and with species: Alaskan bears were observed ignoring it, Sierra bears were slightly less likely to attack a group with bells. Maybe because the Sierra bears are more likely to run into hikers wearing them, and hear them as a warning sign, while in Alaska, there's a lot fewer hikers, so it's just an unfamiliar, unimportant noise. But since the bells are cheap, and no one's reported evidence that they increase bear attacks, I'd still be willing to use one. If anyone finds evidence that they really work do work as a dinner bell though, I'll be very quick to change my mind. http://www.backpacker.com/survival/bears-and-the-34-blend-in-34-theory/ , http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490408409513035 , http://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/trail-news/do-bear-bells-really-work/",louder,0.236602366,808,814,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8261

First of all are the fletchings. If they are supposed to be straight, check if they still are. Others have a bend or curve in them, if this is the case check if the curve is still correct. Also check to make sure they are fully attached to the arrow. Second most common problem is the nock. Make sure it hasn't weakened and become loose. Next is the shaft. Make sure it is still straight. You can either look down its length from the head (away from your eye) or spin it on your palm. The latter takes quite a bit of practice. For wooden arrows make sure there are no chips, scrapes or gouges out of the shaft. If there are it will have to be replaced. Head / points. This is more of a concern on arrows where these can be changed. If you have such an arrow make sure they are well tightened, threaded correctly, and sit straight to the arrow. For anything with barbs make sure they are not bent. Most commonly the only issue you will face shooting a boss is loss or damage of fletchings, and these can easily be replaced. Arrows are commonly made of aluminum, carbon fiber, or a mix of the two. Simple target shooting is unlikely to bend them. The only commonly used bow that uses wooden arrows is a longbow. Hunting is different. If the animal moves, or you hit a bone, it can damage your arrows quite easily. I will add hunting with a bow is not a suggested idea unless you really know what you are doing. There are a lot more variables to take into account than hunting with a gun.

I am approaching this in what is, I sincerely hope, a less inflammatory or sensationalist fashion--- more of a: ""Yes, there is a definite risk. However, I have faced this risk, myself, and lived through it; not only once, but three times. So please do not allow your fear to control you."" By far, the most probable animal ""carriers"" of rabies (as seen from reports of suspicious bites, and animal cadavers which were lab-tested and later proven to have rabies) are small bats. If you are attacked or bitten by ANY creature (even chipmunks have been found to have rabies) without any evident warning, PROMPTLY NOTIFY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES! Do this A.S.A.P!

THREE TIMES? Yes! When younger, I had various jobs that required going ""Out Past the Back of Beyond,"" in wild or ""untamed"" areas, for very long periods of time. It had been impossible to determine, after-the-fact, that an animal killed while ""sampling my taste"" had been rabies-infected, hostile, or just hungry. To be fair, there had been a number of proven rabid-animal attacks in that particular area, prior to our having been sent in; so we knew the danger. Because of the inherent risks I had always kept a medium- to large-caliber handgun close to hand; as well as a utility knife and a machete, as well. A jaguar had once tried to hitch a ride in my canoe, and was dissuaded only by vigorous applications of a Collins machete. As I recall, looking back decades ""after-the-fact,"" the number of injections, and their intervals, had been different, country-by-country and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction; but IT HAD NOT BEEN EXTREMELY PAINFUL, NOR HAD THEY BEEN VERY DEBILITATING. It had been painful on the day the shot was given, and my hip or ""cheek"" was sore for a few days. I remember feeling a general malaise; a feeling of ""not being comfortable,"" but it had not been severe. I was still up to riding horses, Vespas, Jeeps and other vehicles; and while I was ""off my feed"" on the days of the shots, that didn't last. I was actually somewhat glad!

If you want to worry about an animal-threat, worry about a bear picking you for ""not-fast-enough food!"" It is necessary to note I had shot other ""possibly rabid"" animals before they had the opportunity to get close enough to bite me. In all cases the creatures were behaving very suspiciously--- snapping their jaws at ""nothing;"" sitting statue-like while panting very hard and fast; growling or snarling ""for no reason"" and at irregular intervals; plus staring fixedly at people while constantly growling or snarling. All of them had also, I want to stress, looked very ill; they had dirty fur, streaks of fur stuck down by what were evident saliva-streaks, and the like. As soon as the threat was evident, I had aimed very carefully, and shot the poor creatures in their heads.

10856,,How safe are stoppers/rocks when threaded through rock tunnels?,less secure/safe,"Your main concern here is going to be shock loading . Nuts are typically tested to resist static compression load. Any shock is typically adsorbed by the rope and other equipment, so they get the mimimum shock load when/if you fall. If they don't fit well and are loose (or are just passed though a hole and are therefore moving around all over the place) then when/if you fall they will hit the rock and shock load. There is no give in the wire or metal so the full fall factor is concentrated in a very small area. This has the potential to take the equipment past it's limits and therefore break it. Even ignoring the shock loading on the equipment your also going to shock load the rock, this can make it break. Think pulling on a hold vs hitting it with a hammer. Then there's your slings, etc. Depending on the material you are again potentially shock loading them due to the movement in the anchor. All in all, this is likely less secure/safe than a well placed secure nut in a crack and should be avoided. You'd be better off attaching a nylon sling around the ""tunnel"". Here's some work DMM did on the effect of shock loading on slings to give you an idea of how it can affect a system. Or would the forces even be smaller since the stopper distributes them around the hole If anything you're distributing the load less evenly. A well placed nut should have the maximum surface area in contact with the rock. The more surface area the more the load is distributed. Only the top of your knut is in contact with the rock and if it's loose then not even that initially. So your actually concentrating the load!

11066,,How to use a Munter hitch to belay and rappel?,double stranded,"To answer your question as to the ideal break position when using the munter: It depends . It depends on your comfort and experience with the knot, its application and the situation. I have rappeled and belayed with munter-hitches on numeral occasions. A double stranded munter-hitch rappel provides a significant amount of friction and unless you want to come to a complete stop you will probably be breaking by your hips. For single stranded rappels, especially on thin ropes breaking at the hip instead of towards the anchor can be disconcerting. It is doable though, and it is nice to at least know that lifting your arm will stop you. If you are rappeling with a load, either in a rescue situation or with a haul-bag, I would highly recommend breaking towards the anchor, at least until you have gotten used to the situation. If you want extra safety in situations like those, check out the Double Munter , which lets you manage heavier loads and has the added benefit of not twisting your rope. I would say top-rope belaying, mentioned here for completeness, is the most awkward of applications, since you have to pull rather than release the rope through a shifting knot. I would say it is pretty unlikely you will be doing that for long by pulling towards the anchor, since that is super tiering. Belaying a leader from the ground is slightly less awkward, but still not as nice as belaying from the top, where the munter shines at its best. The following illustration is from the climbing and mountaineering bible Freedom of the Hills , which by the way every aspiring climber should have in his or her bookshelf. Learning the munter is absolutely not optional. It has saved my behind a couple of times when I have cast off without a belay device. I wouldn't recommend using the munter though unless for practice or in situations when absolutely necessary, since it turns the rope into a twisted mess.",double stranded,0.240477711,255,270,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11066
11269,,How should I vet belayers? What should I look for?,gear,"Be observant If you go to the gym often take note of who the regulars are and their general abilities. You aren't going to know everyone's name but you might get a rough idea of their capabilities. This will give you introduction lines like: I haven't seen you around here very much. Are you new? I noticed you mostly stick to bouldering. Last week this lady almost dropped me. Do you mind if we run through a quick refresher together? I noticed you have been working XYZ route with your partner. Just incase you haven't seen me belaying people do you want me to demonstrate my belay technique? Experienced doesn't mean experienced with a GriGri I climbed for quite a while before I handled a GriGri. Instead of asking if they're experienced, ask if they're experienced with a GriGri . In the comments David Richerby nicely expanded this idea: Asking ""Are you experienced in [this specific skill]?"" rather than ""Are you experienced in [this general area]?"" is excellent advice for almost any situation. Don't assume that somebody who is generally experienced necessarily has experience with the specific thing you need. Ask to join a group instead Scout a few pairs and notice how comfortable they are on belay. When you're comfortable with their abilities explain your situation and ask if you could join their group. This strategy admittedly works better if you're moderately social so you aren't walking up to them completely cold. I know I'd help out a friend in that situation. Hi Erik and Ben, my partner couldn't make it tonight do you mind if work this route with you guys for a little bit? Look at their gear You can tell a lot about a climber based on the gear that they wear. Does the person have really worn shoes, and a brand new harness? Either the person just got a new harness or they've been mostly bouldering. Does the person have a harness with nut tool dangling on the back? Odds are the person is doing some trad climbing outside of the gym. Roflo also added a comment about weight disparities. I'd like to add that I've seen long-time belayers struggle when faced with a climber that's considerably heavier than they're used to. I even recall one guy saying something like ""be careful, I'm heavier than I look"" to every new belayer he met. If you think you're a deceptively heftier person than the average you might want to consider mentioning it. Ideally the belayer would be extra vigilant for those kinds of things with a new partner, but that obviously isn't always the case.",gear,0.075198412,1613,1617,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11269

The increased risk of being solo, is more quantifable and that is what my answer focuses on. The major increase in risk of doing a via ferrata alone (as opposed to in a group or with a partner) is that if you get injured (e.g., from a fall, rock fall, or a bee sting), you will be alone. This is not that different from any other outdoor activity in remote, or semi-remote, areas. In general, there are more chances to become injured on a via ferrata than say walking on flat well maintained trails but less than more difficult ""class 5"" rock climbing. Being alone on a via ferrata, similar to walking, does not dramatically increase your chance of being initially injured. This is unlike, for example, class 5 rock climbing where rope soloing is more dangerous than climbing in roped pairs due to the technical limitations of self belay. There are some safety advantages of having a partner to double check your system in a via ferrata and for unknown routes (or unknown weather) for providing a sanity check.",if you get injured,0.069389679,284,302,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11890

Commonly after an hour, the ears of the Opossum start to move slightly. This is your indicator to know that it's an actor :) After four hours of stiff ears, you can be pretty sure that you are looking down on a dead animal. Call the competent authority (local veterinarian, wildlife rehabilitator, animal control etc.) for assistance. From Wildlife Rescue Rehab : Give a ""dead"" opossum the benefit of the doubt before disposing of the body. It may be ""playing possum"" as an involuntary response to a threat, in which the opossum becomes comatose in the face of danger and appears dead. This may last from 40 minutes to 4 hours. During this time, the opossum lies on its side, becomes stiff, the eyes glaze over, the opossum drools, the tongue lolls out the side of the mouth, and green anal fluid may be seen. This fascinating defense mechanism helps the opossum survive an attack from a predator because many predators give up the attack if they believe the opossum is already dead. Leave the area and give the opossum a chance to recover and move on. The opossum will not respond to prodding or poking . When the opossum is about to recover, the ears move very slightly. I know that this may not be the answer you were looking for, but it's the only way to be absolutely sure, without touching the animal. Interacting with wildlife (poking with a stick, touching it with the bare hand etc.), is no way to go. Further reading: Opossum Society US , Wikipedia Behavior Are there any tell-tale signs indicating an opossum is really dead? As mentioned above, the only real sign is that it hasn't made a single movement (the ears ;)) within at least four hours. So, there aren't any real tell-tale signs. Of course, if the head is apart ... Well, I think you got the concept. Would the flies be buzzing around it if it was actually alive? The opossum releases a stinking fluid when in fear. So, yes, laying there releasing stinky fluid without any movement will result into buzzing. Fear can cause release of a greenish-colored anal fluid. Opossums cannot ‚Äúspray‚Äù, and the only way this unpleasant-smelling body fluid can come in contact with you is if your clothes brush the anal area. It washes off easily.

13222,,How should one properly dispose of a rabid animal carcass?,"incineration, burying","The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has a series of protocols in place for this subject. Protocols for Safe Handling and Disposal of Carcasses: All dead animals should be handled only while wearing gloves; this includes carrying of dead animals, during necropsy procedures, and the dressing out of carcasses. There are several types of gloves to choose from, including leather, rubber, and latex gloves. Rubber or latex gloves are preferred due to their low cost, wide availability, and ease of disinfecting (latex gloves are disposable). The carcass should be placed in a plastic body bag and sealed as soon as possible. If a zoonotic disease is suspected (i.e., rabies, tularemia), it is recommended to double bag the carcass. Avoid direct contact with the dead animal's body fluids (i.e., blood, urine, feces). If contact does occur, wash the skin area contacted with soap and water as soon as possible. Avoid contact with the dead animal's external parasites (i.e., fleas and ticks). If possible, spray the carcass with a flea & tick spray prior to handling it. If pesticide poisoning is suspected as the cause of death and laboratory testing is to be performed on the animal's tissues, avoid spraying the carcass as it will interfere with laboratory results. Proper disposal of the carcass (incineration, burying, etc.) is critical to prevent exposure of other wildlife and humans to disease. Three common effective methods of carcass disposal are: incineration, burying, and rendering. Incineration is the preferred method to use when the carcass is diseased; however, it can also be the most expensive. An acceptable alternative is to bury the carcass. The carcass should be buried at least 4 feet deep and covered with lime to discourage scavengers from uncovering and consuming it. Persons who have direct contact with wildlife, especially carnivorous animals, on a regular basis are highly recommended to receive the rabies pre-exposure vaccination series. The pre-exposure series consists of a total of three vaccinations (refer to Appendix E - California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2004) and is highly efficacious in preventing rabies. It is also recommended to have a rabies antibody titer tested every two years to determine the level of protection. Whenever there is an unusual mortality or die-off of wildlife the Wildlife Investigations Lab should be contacted to determine if a necropsy and disease investigation is recommended. The carcass(s) should be refrigerated as soon as possible until a decision is made as to its disposition. Burial is the usually the preferred method of disposal. When a site acceptable to the local environmental protection agency is available, burial is usually the preferred method of disposal. In selecting a burial site, it is necessary to consider the adequacy of soil depth and to avoid underground electrical cables, water pipes, gas pipes, septic tanks, and water wells. - Overview of Disposal of Carcasses and Disinfection of Premises. As for burning a carcass: Burning in an incinerator that is operated in compliance with local laws and ordinances is an excellent means to dispose of one or a few carcasses and is the preferred means for sheep with scrapie and cattle with BSE. Burning carcasses in an open site should be done only when legally permitted. - Overview of Disposal of Carcasses and Disinfection of Premises. Points to Consider 1. Burial ‚Ä¢Secure the landowner's permission ‚Ä¢Pick a location that will protect both surface water and ground water from contamination. The grave should be at least 200 feet away from any wells used to supply drinking water ‚Ä¢Ideally, the carcass should be covered with two feet of soil within a day of burial.

13246,,How can I tell if a wild animal has rabies?,a little background information,"In order to understand the question of rabies and whether or not an animal is rabid, a little background information is necessary. Once rabies infection occurs, the virus grows in muscle tissue and may go undetected for several days or months. During this incubation (or latent) period, the animal appears healthy and shows no sign of infection. Usually within 1 to 3 months, the virus migrates to the nerves near the site of the infection and spreads to the spinal cord and brain (i.e., the central nervous system). It usually takes from 12 to 180 days to spread through the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. At this point, the disease progresses rapidly, and the animal begins to show the classic behavioral signs of rabies. The virus spreads to the saliva, tears, breast milk and urine. The animal usually dies in 4 or 5 days. Rabies causes typical symptoms. The infection progresses in a predictable manner, from the initial prodormal phase to the excitative, or furious, phase to the final paralytic phase. The first sign usually is a change in behavior . Pet owners should be aware that behavioral changes can occur as a result of many conditions, from digestive disorders to poisoning. Rabid animals usually stop eating and drinking, and may appear to want to be left alone. After the initial onset of symptoms, the animal may become vicious or begin to show signs of paralysis. Some rabid animals bite at the slightest provocation and others may be somnolent and difficult to arouse. Once the animal shows signs of paralysis, the disease progresses very quickly and the animal dies. The early symptoms of rabies tend to be subtle, last 2 to 3 days, and include the following: ‚Ä¢Change in tone of the dog's bark ‚Ä¢Chewing at the bite site ‚Ä¢Fever ‚Ä¢Loss of appetite ‚Ä¢Subtle changes in behavior The second phase of infection usually lasts 2 to 4 days and not all rabid animals experience it. Animals that enter immediately into the final paralytic phase are sometimes said to have dumb or paralytic rabies. Animals that spend most of their diseased state in the furious phase are sometimes said to have furious rabies. An infected dog may viciously attack any moving object, person, or animal; a caged rabid dog will chew the wire, break their teeth, and try to bite a hand moving in front of the cage. Rabid cats will attack suddenly, biting and scratching. Foxes will invade yards and attack dogs, cows, and porcupines. They may show the following signs: ‚Ä¢Craving to eat anything, including inedible objects ‚Ä¢Constant growling and barking ‚Ä¢Dilated pupils ‚Ä¢Disorientation ‚Ä¢Erratic behavior ‚Ä¢Episodes of aggression ‚Ä¢Facial expression showing anxiety and hyperalertness ‚Ä¢Irritability ‚Ä¢No fear of natural enemies (e.g., wild animals may not be afraid of people) ‚Ä¢Restlessness ‚Ä¢Roaming ‚Ä¢Seizures ‚Ä¢Trembling and muscle incoordination The third and final phase of infection usually lasts for 2 to 4 days. Initial symptoms include the following: ‚Ä¢Appearance of choking ‚Ä¢Dropping of the lower jaw (in dogs) ‚Ä¢Inability to swallow, leading to drooling and foaming of saliva (i.e., ""foaming at the mouth"") ‚Ä¢Paralysis of jaw, throat, and chewing muscles Paralysis then spreads to other parts of the body, the animal becomes depressed, rapidly enters a coma and dies. - Health Communities . Nota Bene : This also depends on your area. For example the UK has been free of rabies since 1902. Much of Europe is now rabies free as is Australia.

Being cold blooded they warm themselves by basking in the sun In North America, migrations are seen annually in late summer and early fall, when thousands to millions of insects stream southward along coasts, lake shores, and mountain ridges from Canada down to Mexico and the West Indies, passing along both coasts of the United States and through the Midwest. Movement back north is less obvious, but we know it occurs because mature adult dragonflies appear early in spring at places where overwintering resident immatures (nymphs) have not yet emerged.

14118,,How can you tell if roadkill is safe to eat?,Your old factory sensors,"For most people to even start considering eating roadkill would mean getting over our personal demon of squeamishness. This thought would not appeal to most. Here are eight (8) important rules to consider before one should eat roadkill. 8 Rules of Roadkill Follow these Roadkill Rules to help determine if food by Ford is safe to swallow. 1. Legal Stuff Any fur-bearing animal or bird is edible. However, laws on harvesting roadkill or possession of protected species vary from state to state. In the Peach state, motorists may collect deer without notifying authorities. Bear collisions must be reported but you get to keep the bruin. Texas and California are among the few states that prohibit roadkill collection. In Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife personnel collect reported road-killed animals and distribute to charities helping the needy. Check your state laws first! 2. Impact Damage The point of impact determines how much meat is salvageable. My experience with broadside impacts are not good. Internal organs usually rupture and taint the meat. Not to mention all the bloodshot meat. As in hunting, a head shot saves meat. Tire treads over the body usually means a bloody mess. Squashed squirrel would require a spatula to remove from the asphalt and should be avoided. 3. Clear Eyes If the eyes are intact and clear, the animal is likely a fresh kill. Cloudy eyes hint that the animal has been dead for some time (more than a few hours). Creamy discharges around the eyes or other orifices indicate a sick animal. If the eyes are gone, leave it alone. 4. Stiffness and Skin Rigor mortis sets within a few hours of death. This is not a deal breaker depending on other indicators. The steak in the butcher‚Äôs glass counter has undergone the same process of ‚Äúdecay‚Äù or tenderizing. Pinch the skin of the animal, unless it‚Äôs a porcupine, to check if the skin still moves freely along top of the muscle beneath. If so, you‚Äôre probably okay. Skin stuck to the muscle is a bad indicator. If fur can be pulled from the hide with a slight tug, the animal has been deceased far too long. 5. Bugs and Blood Fleas feed on the blood of warm blooded animals. Brush the hair on the carcass and inspect for fleas like you would on a family pet. If fleas are present, that‚Äôs a good thing. Fleas won‚Äôt stick around on a cold body. There‚Äôs usually blood involved when animals come in contact with 3,000 pound machines in motion. Blood all over the road may mean there‚Äôs too much damaged meat to salvage. The color of blood present should be a dark red, like, well, fresh blood. Dark puddles of blood have been there been there a while. Flies could be a bad sign. They lay larvae in wounds and other openings of the body. A few flies present isn‚Äôt always a deal breaker. A prior wound on a living animal may contain maggots. We had a live deer seek refuge in my mother-in-laws car port who had a broken hind leg from a vehicle collision which was infested with maggots. I approached her in an attempt to humanely dispatch her and put her out of her misery. Sadly, she gained her footing and disappeared through our neighborhood woods. In the hot, humid summers of Georgia, it only takes a few minutes for flies to zero in on dead stuff. Which brings us to our next consideration... 6. Climate and Weather The weather conditions and geographical location are variables to consider. Cold to freezing temperatures is ideal ‚Äì think‚Ä¶ roadside walk-in freezer or fridge. Meat will decompose quickly in hot and humid conditions. 7. Smell This one is pretty obvious. If it has a putrid odor, leave it alone. You don‚Äôt have to be a TV survival expert to identify bad meat. Your old factory sensors will let you know‚Ä¶ along with your gag reflex. 8. Collection and Processing Tips Our vehicles are prepared with Get Home Kits. You may want to add a few items to it or build a separate Roadkill Kit. My kit is simple and includes: ‚Ä¢Tarp ‚Ä¢Surgical gloves If you don‚Äôt drive a pickup truck, wrap large carcasses in a tarp and place in the vehicle for transport. Smaller animals usually go in a contractor grade garbage bag to get home. It‚Äôs common sense in my mind‚Ä¶ Do NOT field dress an animal on the side of the road! It‚Äôs dangerous, illegal (hopefully), unsightly, and disrespectful to both animal and human. I‚Äôve seen some really stupid and disgusting practices over the years from unethical ‚Äúhunters‚Äù and idiots. If you‚Äôre not prepared to harvest game properly, stick with the supermarkets.

14712,,How should you treat an open wound in the backcountry?,"rinsing around and then in the wound, preferably with clean water","A good wilderness first-aid reference is included below to give you a better grasp on how to handle different wounds. Here's some key points for a wound like a knife wound you described. Note that the best first-aid will depend on the details of the wound, the wounded, and what conditions are present for treatment (who's around, how far is advanced help, what materials are available, etc.) Apply pressure to wound using something absorbent and preferably sterile to prevent excessive bleeding. I've done this using cotton bandanas and clothing before. Sterile gauze would be better. There may be still better designed items for this. Do this until bleeding is controlled. If bleeding cannot be controlled, you may need to use a tourniquet to restrict blood flow to the wound, which is a dangerous treatment. If the wound is on a head, don't apply pressure, rather wrap the wound with extra absorbancy. After bleeding is controlled, you'll want to clean, close, and dress the wound to prevent infection. Throughout this process, the more sterile the items involved the better. Cleaning is first done mechanically, using hands to tweezers or whatever your have to remove coarse debris from in and around the wound. Cleaning moves on to rinsing around and then in the wound, preferably with clean water, with enough pressure and volume to really rinse out exposed flesh. You may need to hold the wound or parts of it open at this point to help rinse it. More and more I hear alcohol and other sterilizing solutions should not be used as it interferes with your body's own defensive and regenerative abilities. Use medical tape and bandages to close and cover the wound once it is clean. If you cannot clean the wound, do what you can to prevent it from getting dirtier but make sure the wound has air flow and can drain as needed. Dressings should not restrict circulation much if at all - this part is about facilitating healing and preventing additional contamination. Writing this I remember some important things I learned when dealing with wounds in the wilderness. Control bleeding before you rinse. Cut and in a panic, I once poured water on a deep and dirty slice thinking I needed to get it clean ASAP. This was the wrong sequence for two reasons: It ended up being that the best thing I had to control bleeding wasn't totally clean, so the water was really needed after that point. The other, more important issue is that by rinsing the fresh wound, I washed away blood that would have been better to keep in place and serve to slow additional bleeding and eventually clot the wound and defend against infection. (That latter point is according to a doctor I consulted, and it makes sense in retrospect.) Antiseptic rinse can be good. The whiskey thread you linked to points out some subtlety about this. I think it ultimately depends on the conditions and what's available, to decide whether or not to try and sterilize the wound to any extent more than clean water rinsing. Sometimes water is best, I think especially if your body is going to need to resist or fight infection with little help from the outside later on. Sometimes it's better to clean the wound with hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, or some other kind of sterilizing solution, then keep it protected until you're in better conditions to get outside help and heal yourself. Sometimes, you know and have access to plants that can treat your wound well - I've seen herbalism in the field work well, but I don't know it well enough to make any recommendations beyond acknowledging it. Ultimately you want the wound to: lead to as little blood loss as possible; be rinsed of outside debris and contamination; be able to use your body's natural defenses and healing, which includes the need for some air flow; and be able to stay free of outside debris and contamination. All the while, the healthier you can stay overall, the better, and I think that includes maintaining some careful level of activity to ensure good blood flow.

14957,,How exactly do you cut down a tree with fire?,cut the top of the stump off and split into small pieces,"Unless you are building a bridge you don't. If you don't have the tools to cut it down you don't have the tools to do anything with it once it is down. You are converting it from a big living standing tree to a big dead laying down tree. Neither of which you have the tools to modify. The only scenario where this adds any value to your life is if your life depends on crossing a river and you can make the tree fall across the river or gorge. Which would require a tree close to the river that is tall enough to span the gap. As pointed out in Erik's answer even when the tree falls it may or may not fall according to your plans. Once it hits the ground it going to bounce and the bottom of the tree may end up several feet from the stump, which could be over the edge of the gap you are trying to span. All of the above aside, it takes a lot of fuel and a lot of time to actually burn through a tree. Back in my homesteading days, there was a large stump in my front yard. I had a chainsaw, pick, axe and endless supply of scrap wood from a local mill. The stump was about 8 or 10 feet tall, and 6 or 8 feet wide. An old growth Douglas Fir. Most old growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) range in height from 200 to 250 feet, and have a diameter of 5 to 8 feet. source The first year, I cut the top of the stump off and split into small pieces to use to burn through the stump. Around the second or third year I got access to the mill scrapes. Burning through this stump was my hobby, while I didn't work on it everyday, I worked on it several times per week, If I was out doing something I would rekindle the fire. As you can see in the image, a small fire is eating through the tree trunk at ground level. It leaves a little overhang which I would split off occasionally and use to fuel the fire. The picture below is years into the process of burning through the trunk of a tree that was maybe 250 feet tall when it was alive. Early on I hit some sap veins which helped fuel the fire, and allowed me to burn into the center of the trunk I could have 2 or 3 small files burning inside, while I was inside the trunk. Burning through a tree takes huge amounts of good quality fuel. I can't even begin to guess how much wood I burned in little fires eating their way through the trunk. If you measured in truck loads, it would be several. The moral here , is that if you have visions of burning a tree down to use for fire wood, you are going to spend more time gathering more fuel to get the tree down then you will gain in fire wood once it is down. Then you will have to gather more fuel and build more fires to burn it into pieces you can move. P.S. A big bonfire does not burn through a tree trunk. It does not transfer enough heat to the tree to consume it. How? So I told you all the reasons it is impractical for most of the common reason you would want to fell a tree. But what if you really did need to spend the time and energy required to fell a tree and fire was your best tool? Assuming only found natural implements (rocks, sticks, bones) for tools and fire. Make extremely sure the tree is not hollow. Or you will have a huge Timber Tote Fire Log Clear the lower branches, all around the tree. Give yourself room to work. Most bark is a natural fire retardant, remove the bark around the base of the tree, all the way around, you only need to clear it a foot or half a meter up. This will kill the tree and help to dry the wood. Inspect the base of the tree, clear anything that is growing for 3 feet or meter around. Look which way the tree is leaning, that is the way it is going to want to fall. Wherever the widest gap is between roots on the side it is leaning to, dig out some dirt around the roots. This is where you are going to build you primary fire. Peel the bark off of the roots and build a small fire in the hollow between the roots. Think of it as little oven. You start baking the roots/tree stump and the dirt. The trunk and roots are full of liquids, progress is going be much slower then you think. As the fire burns it will char the wood and dry out the dirt. As the dirt drys out it becomes easier to remove, allowing you to get a fire around the roots. You just keep digging ( dirt and charred wood ) and burning until you get well under the tree. You don't want to go deep, just a couple inches, but you need to get through the to the center. AFTER you get a bit more then half way through the side it is leaning towards, you do the same on the other side. This is the second cut (same as tree felling) that allows the tree to fall on towards the side you hollowed out in the first step. It will be more likely to fall the way you hope, if you leave a hing on both side. Don't work all the way around like a beaver, or Murphy will have it landing exactly were you least expected and can least afford it to land. Restating: a small fire is best. It going to be slow going, and your going to be tempted to stack a bunch of wood. But flames more then a hand high from where you are working is just waste.",cut the top of the stump off and split into small pieces,0.070284598,1295,1351,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14957
15026,,How to triangulate your position with a map and compass?,take multiple bearings with the compass to recognizable points and draw them on the map,"The basic idea behind triangulation is take multiple bearings with the compass to recognizable points and draw them on the map . Where they intersect is your location. You want the lines to be as close to perpendicular as possible, for the sake of accuracy. The reason is that when the lines are perpendicular, a change in the angle isn't as significant . See how the angle between the red and the green lines in Example B is much smaller than the one in Example A, and yet the difference between where the red line intersects the black line and where the green line intersects the black line is much greater . Beyond using multiple points, there are other ways to do this. For instance if you are on a long natural feature like a trail or stream or ridge, you can take one bearing to a feature off to the side. You can also take a bearing parallel to a feature like a curving river and that will give you a good idea of where you could be as the other places along that feature wouldn't be parallel. One a rounded hill, if you have an altimeter, you can take a bearing directly up or down the hill and find where that bearing runs perpendicular to the contour lines and crosses your current elevation . Off the three other examples above, the one off to the side is the most accurate, the parallel one depends on the situation and only really give a possible location and the last depends on the accuracy of your altimeter.",take multiple bearings with the compass to recognizable points and draw them on the map,0.313803643,39,126,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15026
15578,,How can I identify Woolly Adelgid on a Hemlock tree?,The white dots,"As far as I can see, only your original picture from 2016 shows sign of woolly adelgid. The tree is not in focus since the point of the picture was the doves, but here are some clues: The white dots look characteristic of a woolly adelgid infestation, and a rather severe one if the dots can be seen from the top of the branches. Another clue is the defoliation: Notice how needles are clearly missing in several places, particularly on the branch at lower middle of this snippet. Here is a typical look of a mature woolly adelgid infestation. It is most obvious on the underside of branches. Often you will find pieces of branches on the ground, such as this one. This picture was taken in Groton MA on 30 Apr 2016: Often this can only be seen when looking at the undersides of branches. Severe infestations can be seen from the tops of the branches, as this one in Beverley MA on 7 Jul 2016: What made me originally ask about the time and location of your picture (you've told us time, but I'd still like to know location) was that I observed something unexpected happen during the summer of 2016. There were several infestations in Groton that were quite evident in the fall of 2014. That winter, one night got down to about -15¬∞F, which seems to have killed off most woolly adelgid in the area. There was very little to be found in the spring of 2015, and thru most of that year. The next winter only got to -5¬∞F, which is apparently not low enough to kill off the pest. Things started off in the spring of 2016 about where they left off in the fall of 2015, with some severe infestations by July 2016. I didn't monitor the woolly adelgid again until fall, when I tried to find a good candidate location for testing a bio-control. To my suprise, most of the places I checked showed no current signs of adelgid, and even some recovery of the trees. Most trees seemed to have healthy needles at branch tips, even though further back the needles were still lacking that had dropped previously. Here is a good example of the foliage pattern: This was in Groton on 6 Nov 2016, and characteristic of many hemlocks in the area. Note the unusual pattern of needles at the tips of branches, with no needles further back towards the trunk. There was no adelgid directly visible in this tree and most others, although it could still be found here and there in this stand. Something interesting happened in the summer of 2016, which I'd like to understand. We had a unusually dry summer, with drought conditions in much of Massachusetts. Most of the hemlocks grow in wet areas, that at least stayed damp. I don't think the drought affected the hemlocks directly, but may have contributed to the adelgid decline. It seems this should be studied. It would be useful to understand what did in the adelgid during the summer of of 2016. Perhaps this could give a clue towards a new control technique. I've been trying to connect up with people doing research in this area, with only limited success.

If you have alerted the authorities (life guard, police, ambulance, etc.) or can't for some reason then you can try the below. The Royal society for the prevention of accidents (Rospa) has the following advice : Rescuing a drowning person is the last resort and you should do everything possible to avoid getting into a dangerous situation in the first place. If you have to make a rescue attempt, think of your own safety first and never put yourself in danger. If the rescue is too dangerous, wait until the emergency services arrive . Reach With a long stick, a scarf, clothes or anything else. Crouch or lie down to avoid being pulled in. Wade Test the depth with a long stick before wading in and then use the stick to reach out. Hold on to someone else or the bank. Throw A rope is best - you can then pull in the person. Otherwise throw something that will float - a ball, a plastic bottle, a lifebuoy. This will keep the person afloat until help comes. Row Use a boat if there is one nearby and if you can use it safely. Do not try to pull the person on board in case they panic and capsize the boat. So basically do whatever you can to reach the person without entering the water yourself. Many dangerous areas have life rings, etc. These should be your first port of call. If you can't safely get to the person, don't try! This is pretty hard I'd imagine but the correct thing to do. To add a brief note to: Let's assume that we see someone is drowning near the lake shore and we're the only person in the immediate vicinity What about your phone? Pretty much everyone has a mobile phone these days. Even if you don't have signal you can often call the emergency services. Mobile phone companies will share bandwidth for emergency calls hence the ""emergency calls only"" message on your phone. So your phone may say it doesn't have signal but it can (often) access signal for a 999(112, 911, etc insert your emergency phone number here ) call.

16462,,How to confirm/remove ticks in tough spots when alone?,using my fingernails as tweezers,"Determining whether it's a tick If you have a digital camera or mobile phone with you, you could try photographing your suspected tick. I don't have a tick handy for testing purposes, but I just tried a couple of close-up shots with my mid-range 2015 phone and it doesn't have any trouble imaging features well under a millimetre in size. A high-end phone or digital camera ought to do even better. However, even if you can't confirm with total certainty that it's a tick, there are a couple of removal techniques you could attempt. Removing the suspected tick Some sources recommend freezing the tick using a medical freezing spray , and letting the dead tick drop off naturally. If you plan ahead and bring freezing spray, this should let you remove a tick from anywhere you can reach to detect one. (However, some sources also recommend against freezing ticks, claiming that it can encourage them to regurgitate their stomach contents.) If your suspected tick isn't actually a tick, this technique won't do any harm. If I found myself in this situation and didn't have freezing spray, I'd probably go with the (generally discouraged) technique of using my fingernails as tweezers. This risks squeezing the tick's body, but I think it's the lesser of two evils. And I think that my fingertips are sensitive enough to get the positioning right without being able to see what I'm doing. Like the freezing spray, this is a technique you can try even if you're not sure it's a tick.

It's not very likely that there is no range at which the pack will fit you. The fact that the picture shows the strap lifting up off the shoulder a little does suggest that the wearer in this picture should tighten that lower adjustment strap a little, and it also suggests that there is no significant weight inside the pack at this time. There's probably a pillow or packing peanuts or something in it just for the photo shoot. If the pack was packed with gear, food, water, or anything heavy, the pack's weight would ideally mostly be borne on the hips by the waist strap, and the shoulder straps mainly serve to keep the pack up straight rather than falling over sideways or falling off backwards. You can snug the straps up tight to move the load off your hipbones and onto your shoulders, but, I only do that when my hips get sore and need a 10 or 15 minute break. Then I'll loosen the shoulder load and let the pack settle onto my hips again. You'll also see, above and behind the wearer's shoulder, another adjustment strap which controls how tightly the upper part of the pack is pulled toward the wearer's back. Again, this isn't to ""fit"" over the top of the curve of the shoulder, it's to hold the pack upright, so, it's not important that you see in the picture that that strap meets the pack well above the height of the wearer's shoulder. It's pulling the pack toward the front of her shoulder from above, it's not supposed to be hanging the weight of the pack off the top of her shoulder. I don't think you need to worry about this particular pack not fitting you. It has several adjustments available and appears that it could fit quite a range of wearers. Just understand that the best fit for long hiking wear is such that the padded waist strap puts most of the load onto your hips, and the shoulder straps should hold the load above your hips up straight so it's not falling off behind or to the side and twisting at your waist.

18145,,How to progress in rock climbing after grades v4 / 5.11+?,gains become more and more difficult,"Before embarking on specifics, a word of advice: learn to love plateaus . When beginning climbing, we make drastic improvements seemingly every time we go out. As we improve, gains become more and more difficult. There will still be jumps in ability, but they will become more and more sporadic. Learn to love climbing for the movement and adventure, for the striving towards mastery. With that being said, here are the things that I would focus on: Unless you're particularly unfit, you generally don't need to focus too much on climbing specific fitness at this stage. That being said, core exercises and gentle hangboarding would generally be beneficial at around the stage it sounds like you're at. Take an honest assessment of your abilities--what are your strengths and weaknesses? You say you regularly flash V4...does that include V4 in every possible style? Overhanging pinches / smeary slabs / dynamic problems / .... ? Indoors and outdoors, on plastic / granite / sandstone / limestone / ...? Train your weaknesses . Actively seek them out---look for your ""vegetable problems"" that you know you should really work on, not just your ""dessert problems"" that you can flash to show off. Try climbing in styles that challenge your habits: intentionally use uncomfortably high or low feet, climb as slowly and statically as possible, climb as fast and dynamic as you can, ... Intentional practice. So you just flashed a V4. Congratulations! Now what? You can never climb that problem ever again and have your ego adequately inflated, or you can critically analyze your performance---was it a ""lucky"" send that was super-shaky and seconds away from falling the entire time? Did you climb it perfectly ? Try climbing that problem 5 more times (with rest in between), striving to make each attempt better. Hone in on the tiniest micro-beta, key in to precisely what body positions make the problem work. A professional musician doesn't play through a piece of music once and then try to perform it in concert; a professional golfer spends hours upon hours at a driving range polishing their swing. Similarly, strive for mastery , not just ""sending."" Get honest critical feedback. While this could be as formal as finding a coach, try starting with seeking out stronger climbers (or even comparably skilled climbers) and asking them to watch you climb a problem and then critique your movement. Similarly, try recording yourself climbing and looking at the video afterwards---you can often spot better ways to move and eliminate inefficiencies when you aren't in the middle of trying to perform these movements. Think of it like a professional athlete reviewing every play on the game tape. Perhaps especially pertinent: try harder problems . One very, very loose rule of thumb is that for sport climbing, your redpoint/project grade should generally be about a number grade harder than your onsight grade. For example, if you are onsighting 11b, you should be redpointing 12b. If you're flashing V4, you should be redpointing V6. As the adage goes, ""If you aren't falling, you aren't trying."" If you watch almost any climbing video ever , it will invariably show the hero climber falling. Over. And over. And over. Hard problems are hard and we learn by falling slightly later each time. Try seeking out a short (<5 moves) sequence that feels severely difficult, but not impossible. Practice just this sequence for 20 minutes. If you manage to do the sequence in this amount of time, it was too easy and you need to set higher goals. Come back to this exact same sequence each week for a month.

Elite swimmers will wear suits with soft and flowing curves, and no extraneous material. Some even go so far as to shave their body to reduce drag their hair might have. I don't know if that's effective or not, but when races are won by a thousandths of a second, perhaps it's worth it. Clothes that are worn are not made with elite swimming in mind, and so any material - cotton or not - which doesn't easily allow water to pass through it or by it will tend to drag the swimmer, leading to early fatigue. If one were to wear tight-fitting clothes, which allows water to pass around it more easily, that could reduce that lag; but if the clothes were too tight, that can be restrictive on the muscles needed for motion or breathing. In addition, cotton does bind to water, and holds tight to it. This is the reason we advocate against wearing cotton in cold weather, because water that gets into the fabric will have a tendency to cling to it, making the wearer colder. In the water, again, there isn't much of a thermal effect because water is in contact with the body regardless of the cotton; but the fact remains that cotton binds with water. When you are swimming, you're dragging all that water along creating additional drag. So, wearing a loose-fitting rayon shirt, for example, will have a tendency to drag the swimmer. But a similarly-fitting cotton shirt will have more of a drag effect because it holds onto the water. Try swimming with a jacket on, and you'll feel the extra weight you're lugging around when you swim. This is a reason we call for removal of as much clothing as possible when there is a need to swim some distance. If you tread or are using a life-saving device, the clothing won't matter - and will come in handy once rescued.",you're dragging all that water along creating additional drag,0.063918047,1474,1535,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18589
19148,,How can I photograph a kingfisher in the United Kingdom?,visit a RSPB reserve,"Turns out this is actually quite difficult. Apart from the scarcity a major issue is that Kingfishers in the UK are a Schedule 1 protected species . This essentially means it's illegal to go anywhere near their nest, etc. If you can find somewhere not near a nest then great but this is going to be difficult. You‚Äôll need a licence if you can‚Äôt avoid disturbing birds listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 when they‚Äôre: nest building rearing young You‚Äôll need to apply for a licence to: disturb wild birds to survey for science, education and conservation work disturb wild birds for photography You should also report your actions taken under these licences to Natural England following the guidance on the report form. Applying for a schedule one license is (purposely) very difficult. Any nest locations are closely guarded secrets or under 24 hour surveillance. I saw one thread on a photography Facebook group that basically told one person asking that ""No one is going to tell you this information"". Now that said UK right of way seems to trump this. So if you're on a right of way (footpath) etc. then you can observe the birds from there. But if you set foot off the footpath then you'd be breaking the schedule one restrictions, so this is going to make it difficult to find a good location. Also note the restriction on not disturbing the bird . This seems purposely open ended. You could argue that you're not causing a disturbance by simply photographing them. You might be on shaky ground here unless you're in a good hide, etc. as I would guess even scaring the birds would count as disturbance. But then how do you hide if you can't leave the path!

19366,,How to tell the difference between bobcats and house cats?,elongated tail,"The domestic cat and the bobcat look completely different, so it would be fairly easy to distinguish them. The bobbed tail cannot be relied on by itself, as there is a domestic breed of cat called the Manx that has a naturally bobbed tail, as well. However, this breed is a bit rare compared to all of the other breeds of domestic cat, which have a naturally long tail, so it does make for a good first rubric. Other than a bobbed tail, Manx cats look identical to their domestic brethren [ 1 ][ 2 ]: Bobcats, on the other hand, look more like their cousin, the lynx [ 3 ][ 4 ]: There's also the component of size. Bobcats start life larger than domestic cats, and grow to a larger size in adulthood, with bobcat kittens weighing approximately 125 grams when measured at a few days old [ 5 ]. Contrast that to the weight of domestic kittens at around the same age being about 100 grams [ 6 ]. Regarding Maine Coon kittens, yes, they have similar ears to bobcats, but it would again be difficult to confuse them, because of the other facial features (they lack the ""mutton chops"" that bobcats and lynx have) and the elongated tail [ 7 ][ 8 ]: References: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_cat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx Breeding Habits of Bobcats in Utah, Jay S.

19477,,How long is the carp mating season at Presque Isle?,late spring to early summer,"I doubt that there are specific dates, other than late spring to early summer. It also depends on the water temperature, and I am sure that fluctuates from year to year slightly. Carp spawn in late spring to early summer, over aquatic vegetation. They may choose a shallow, weedy bay. After rains have swelled their home river over its banks, they may move into flooded fields to deposit eggs on submerged plants. The splashing of their spawning commotion in shallow water can often be seen and heard Carps and Minnows Bowfishing -- which can be done with a compound or crossbow -- is legal in Pennsylvania only for carp and suckers. Fish can be taken day or night year round except in approved trout waters during the closed season. The best fishing, though, lasts just a few weeks in the spring, Campbell said, when fish move into shallower water to spawn. Bowfishing still a niche sport in Western Pennsylvania ""It's part of the carps' courtship,"" said Lorantas. ""You'll hear them or see them splashing about in the shallows and swimming in circles when water gets about 63 degrees. That usually lasts until the water's close to 80.

Large river systems provide excellent carp habitat, but many lakes support resident populations of trophy carp.

20269,,How sophisticated a dust mask can one hope to improvise?,less than an hour,"TL;DR Yes, carbon might be your best bet. I would not bet my life on such a thing if I had not already practiced it though. Carbon is used to filter purify both water (your typical Brita water filter) and air (re-breathers for divers' air), so the potential is there. Farther down I discuss how I would approach this since I have made filters before. I have heard claims that simply wetting the bandana can improve its filtering ability. I have never seen anything to lend great credibility to this, but it makes sense. It probably would not improve by much though, as all it would take is 1 small spot to dry up for the air to go through that spot instead. Maybe if you kept soaking it frequently, but then you would need to be stationary and constantly dipping your face into a lot of water. This does not sound like something I would bother to try except in an emergency in which I was stuck in one place anyway. As far as crafting something, yes, good carbon would be the first thing many of us would think of. I will warn you from experience though, as I have been doing a lot of playing around with this kind of survival crafting; you need to be careful or you could just make matters worse for yourself by inhaling the carbon dust, ash, or other fire byproducts. I accidentally did this recently and got a face and breath full of stinky fire byproducts and did a lot of coughing for a few minutes. Maybe you could improvise a dust mask for... never mind. ;) If you want to go the carbon route Obviously you need a source of carbon I am going to assume that you are sourcing your carbon from the wild rather than bringing activated carbon with you on your trip. First, make sure you actually have good carbon for this. Simply taking the black stuff out of a fire is not going to give you the best charcoal. You need to make sure that you drive off as much of the non-carbon chemicals as you can from the wood. I won't go into details, as that would be an answer to a different question (""How do I make good charcoal?"" could be a good TGO.SE question if not already asked, or you could Google that). But I will say, since many charcoal tutorials don't, that if you want as pure carbon as you can get, make sure you burn it hot. Different chemicals come out at different temperatures, so you can have what looks like great charcoal that could still be reduced closer to pure carbon if it comes from a low-temp fire. Preferably activated carbon (though not necessarily) Even if you get as good quality charcoal as you can, calling it ""activated carbon"" is still questionable at this stage. Different people mean different things when they say activated carbon. Usually it is considered activated when you have processed the carbon by increasing the size of the pores within it. There are various ways of doing that to activate your carbon, most of which are not applicable to the situation you describe. Again, I will gloss over the step of activating and suggest that is another question (""How can I activate my own carbon?""). Even if you do not activate your carbon, that doesn't mean it is useless for your situation. Activating it just makes it work better. It should be powdered carbon So let's say you have made good charcoal and want to use it as your source of carbon in your mask. Generally, carbon is ground into powder so that the gas or liquid to be filtered and purified can move through it. In the situation you describe, you should just make it into the finest dust that you are capable of. When I have done this in the past, I have set the charcoal out on a flat surface and broken it with a stick until it was small pieces, then squished the small pieces with the end of the handle of my knife. If that doesn't get it small enough, I just try to find whatever nearby seems like it will work best to get it into a powder. If you have good stones for grinding, that could work; preferably non -porous stones so it doesn't get caught in the stone. Now to make the device... Now you have your filtration/purification vector, the carbon, but you still need to get it into a form that will actually work for you. This is where your situation is going to start diverging from my experience unfortunately, as I have done this to filter water for drinking but not air for breathing. When I did this in the past, I would use paper if I had it, or the biggest leaf I could find, fill it with the pulverized charcoal, poke some tiny holes in the bottom, and start slowly filtering water through it. Even the muddiest, nastiest, dirtiest water came through looking clean as bottled water out the bottom. For you, though, we need to get it over your mouth and the air moving through it... If I were to attempt this, I would fold the bandana over once or twice if it's big enough, to add more layers to help keep charcoal out of my mouth. I would mix some water with some dirt to make some mud and make a circle of mud on the bandana. Not thin, runny mud, but rather thick mud that will hold its shape well, to make a little circle wall about the size of my mouth opening. Fill it with the carbon (crunched, good quality charcoal), and put something on top of it to hold the charcoal in. My first guess is a leaf with little holes poked into it, though I'm not sure how well that would work... I (and you) would have to experiment a little. Once all that were made, I would hold it up to my mouth and seal the edges with more mud so that air cannot go around it. My thoughts on this device So there is a forest fire nearby and the smoke is choking you out - this is not the time to be wasting on crafting the thing I just described. You would be much better off just getting yourself out of the forest fire. So a dust storm kicks up - if you had no advance warning, you have no time to make this. If you do have advance warning, hopefully making this device is not your best option available. If all you have is the bandana and your other normal gear and you want to make this, it will take hours. If you want really good quality charcoal in the setting you describe, you generally don't make it and use it same day, rather you make it (in the fire) and use it next day after it has thoroughly cooled. So it will take an hour to a day just to get the charcoal if not already available, then gathering the other resources and crafting it takes a while too. It might sound simple, but it's not. The water filters I make are more simple than this, and I usually have to make a few attempts as parts break during the process. I would guess that it would take me at least a few hours the first time I tried to craft this and have it ready to use, and that is if I had all the pieces on hand ready to start putting them together. After making a few practice ones, and if I can get it first try without having to redo anything, then maybe less than an hour. And even then, this is just an educated guess since, again, I've done water filters but not air filters. Carbon is used to filter air too. Activated carbon is one of the materials that can be used to make diving re-breathers, so we know this is possible. But in the situation you describe, this would definitely not be the first thing I tried, and it might be the last. Update: First attempt was not successful I tried this out today. For the first attempt, I did not go all-natural. Instead, I used a disposable water bottle for the base, similar to the answer by Restless Adventurer. That should have made it easier, yet I still ran into problems. The major problems with the device I made: Very difficult to breathe out. I would make a looser seal next time so air can escape around my mouth instead of trying to force it through the carbon filter. In was easy, but only because the carbon shifted out of the way and the air went around the carbon instead of through it. Next time I would try to use something to hold the dust in place better. Some of the dust came out into my mouth and lungs. Very unpleasant. Again, hold it in place better with something that the particles won't go around. After the above changes, I fear that the air might have much difficulty coming in to inhale as well. Might need to make the powder layer less thick, though it already wasn't thick to begin with. I would not dismiss this mask idea entirely, but it is not looking promising. I would not bother trying in survival scenario unless I had lots of time to tinker and could use the results in a controlled environment.",less than an hour,0.237642333,6837,6854,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/20269

I have built food boxes from scratch,"If you are going to go backpacking, get a system your back is going to be happy with. $200 is not unreasonable. I mention several options below, but these are mostly canoe trip use -- portaging is a relatively small part of the trip, and enduring an uncomfortable pack for a 30 minute walk may distract you from the mosquitoes. Backpacking on the other hand, you are wearing the beast for hours at a time. Start with a search for DIY backpacks. I have built food boxes from scratch for canoe trips. Mostly 1/4"" plywood, with internal corner braces. They were waterproof except for the lid, but weighed over 20 pounds empty, and 140 pounds full. There are problems with repurposed items: Many containers work well when supported from below, but are not designed to be supported from the side. They gradually deform under load. The Rubber-Maid style totes made of flexible plastic fall into this category. A weak container that's fine on the floor may not be strong enough to hold straps. Give some thought to how straps attach to the container. Anything you can do to spread this load will help. Other containers are strong enough, but don't fit your back well. This can be compensated by building up parts of the container with layers of closed cell foam (sleeping pad) A 5 gallon pail can work. It's a bit short for most people's backs, You may want to cut the bottom off another pail and use it to extend the bottom. You can replace the lid with a threaded lid. Available from Lee Valley Tools, and various survival stores. Olives are shipped in barrels of various sizes. Generally they have some taper at both ends, and have a screw on lid. The 10 gallon size is about right. Check with places that use lots of olives -- subway, pizza places, greek restaurants. These are commonly used by canoeists to keep gear dry. While the strapping systems work, they aren't comfortable to carry long distances. But on most trips under 10% of the canoe trip is spent portaging. Another option: You can sometimes find old external frame backpacks at used outdoor equipment places. I've seen people lash 2 5 gallon pails with screwtop lids to a frame. This is far more comfortable, but still compare unfavorably to modern backpacks.",DIY backpacks.

21686,,How much experience is needed for crossing the Mendenhall Glacier?,minimal technical experience,"Glaciers pose a risk to travelers because the ice flows like a river. When they flow over features in the landscape the ice buckles and splits creating crevasses. Other than avalanche and rockfall risk on your route, the greatest hazard is falling into a crevasse or moulin or some other trap that you won't escape alive. When the glacier is ""dry"" (i.e. bare) it is easier to observe where crevasses are, but that doesn't make glacier travel risk-free. I'd say the two things you really have to be careful about in dry conditions are snow bridges (i.e. snow-plugged crevasses) that could give out when you attempt to cross them, and heavily crevassed areas. One misstep in a heavily crevassed area can mean death if you and your team are not prepared with a) the right equipment, and b) the skills to stage a rescue and prevent falls in the first place. Andy Tyson makes a valid point -- it is really challenging to arrest someone else's fall on bare ice -- but it can be done, and my personal preference is to rope up in dry conditions if I'm on a team with at least two other people and there are crevasses. Some people don't. If I'm entering very heavily crevassed terrain I rope up just in case a belay is in order. When the glacier is ""wet"" (snow-covered) you have the same risks but with snow, meaning more uncertainty about what's beneath your feet and the risk of avalanches, which should affect whether you decide to remain roped together. But that's not going to be a consideration for you. I just thought I'd mention it. I can't speak about this route from experience. It is hard to judge the topology of a glacier from pictures: the rule of thumb I like to follow in the that it's always bigger than it looks, and it's farther away than it looks, and sometimes it is harder than it looks too. But based on some of the pictures on summit post this looks like a fairly complex glacier with ice flowing over convex landscape features in multiple directions. I'm not sure what your actual route would look like based on what the pictures show, but heavily crevassed areas might be a major concern. Another thing to consider is how you'll get off the glacier. Sometimes there's a big gap between the edge of the glacier and the rock, and you may need some technical skills to navigate that if you can't get around it on foot. As some of the comments point out, your comfort level and skill level comes into play here. What is the risk level to you and your team based on your skill and the hazards? Can you cross the glacier on a path that involves no crevasses or technical barriers? If so, then your objective risk level is low and you could traverse safely with the right equipment and minimal technical experience. On the other hand, if there are crevasses that could swallow you up, do you and your team have the technical skills to mitigate the risk (e.g. set up a belay to minimize risk, perform a team arrest in the event of a fall, perform a self rescue, or perform a team rescue)? Are you prepared to deal with unanticipated hazards? Are you and your team able to make sensible, honest decisions about when to turn back when you have a conflicting desire to reach your goal, or are you all so intensely goal-driven that your judgement could be affected? It's all too easy to rationalize continuing when driven by a goal that is something other than returning home safely, and that can lead to bad outcomes. And remember, everybody on the team has to have the right skills for the terrain.

22639,,How to belay top-rope climbers who are ascending quickly?,auto-belays,"Special devices: @imsodin is right in suggesting a GriGri. For the method: The common trick is to have two ""belayers."" One attaches the GriGri on their harness as usual. The second person stands facing the primary belayer and pulls hand over hand on the rope (essentially pulling away from the primary belayer, through the GriGri). The primary belayer can help by pulling slack down towards the GriGri from above. This should let you belay most climbers quite quickly. But, as always, if at some point there is a lot of slack between the belay device and the climber, the climber must slow down to allow the belayer to catch up. Taking big falls on static rope with slack is dangerous for everyone. Some background: The two-belayer-one-GriGri method was pretty common at local and regional speed climbing competitions in the US until 2018. It was even used at IFSC comps until 2016. In fact, USA Climbing Rule 7.2.1 stated that all routes must be belayed from below and this was the accepted practice. However: Following an incident in 2018 in which a speed climber took a bad fall that was attributed to this belaying style, USA Climbing removed this rule , allowing auto-belays to be used. Similarly, the IFSC and USA Climbing both use special speed auto-belays for speed climbing competition. I can't definitively speak to which is safer, and I'm not sure anyone can. Hopefully this doesn't need saying, but this should only be done indoors with express permission of the gym staff. Note that some gyms double-wrap their ropes at the top of the climb--don't speed climb with this setup as the friction is both annoying and creates more heat, which is bad for the ropes.",auto-belays,0.400957853,1168,1179,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22639

(Though rarely did we plan trips that did not have dependable water sources within a day's walk, meaning we would start and end the day with bellies full of water.) Different people consume (and lose) at different rates, so the above would usually balance out in a group. Addendum: As some have pointed out, there are varying recommendations, and even Grand Canyon National Park seems to have some difference of opinion: exhibit A , and exhibit B Considerations such as difficulty of the terrain, whether there will be a water-source where you are going, whether you start the hike well-hydrated, what time of day you are hiking, etc all play into it. As does the consideration of more water = more weight = more energy expended = more water needed. For some people, adding 2 gallons (7.6 litre) to their pack would make it difficult for them to go anywhere... In short, if you think you need more, take more. Cache water (if possible). Be smart.

218,,How can I start a fire by rubbing two sticks together?,hand-drill,"There are many, many ways to make a fire. Some require more skill, while others depend on carefully prepared equipment. The closest thing to ""rubbing two sticks together"" is the hand-drill . You will need a fireboard (a small cedar board is good) and a thin, straight stick. A knife is good, too. This takes a lot of practice. Hand callouses help. YouTube has many videos: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Even further on the skill end of the scale is the fire plow . Basically you push a stick along a groove in a board. I've heard that native people of the Pacific Northwest would walk up to a cedar tree, cut groove in the side of the tree, and plow up a coal right there. Again, see YouTube: Fire Plow (YouTube) . Successful friction fires requires both good equipment and good technique. If you are just starting out, and you won't know if your failures are caused by equipment or technique. This can make learning very difficult. One fix is to buy a good set from an expert. Learn to make fires with it, then make your own kit. Making any fire requires multiple skills , which you apply in a sequence. A friction method will produce a tiny coal. Once you've mastered that, you still need to be able to make the coal in to a flame (with tinder). Once your tinder is going, you need to light the kindling. Usually you'll add progressively larger fuel to grow the fire for your purposes. Then you need to know how to put the fire out safely . Each of these stages is its own set of skills to learn. Each is contextual (type of wood available, season, weather, etc.). Wet weather is especially challenging, so start learning when it's not raining. However, watch out for your dry season, when runaway fires are particularly risky. Check with your fire department for burn bans . There is no mastery of fire-making. Sometimes, when you're sure that you're doing everything right, you still can't get a good fire going.

Use a biodegradable (e.g. cornstarch-based) bag to pick it up and then pack it in a sealed plastic container. For obvious reasons the container should only be used for that purpose and disinfected when you return home. Burying solid waste in seasonal snow is not sufficient. Whilst in the snow, the cold will slow biodegradation and during a melt the result will be as if you had never buried it at all. In larger or permanent snowfields I've seen the advice of disposing of solid waste at least 200 metres from camps and trails, but, I'd still prefer carrying it out to leave no trace.

My answer is more focused at family camping, but has some relevance to both: With younger children it can be very simple, although possibly not the most comfortable: You sleep across the doorway. For any child to get out at night they need to climb over you. If you think they could sneak around you (if you have a tent with a wide door, for example), you could look at putting a string through the zipper with a loose bow, but I'd tend to advise against this as in an emergency it could cause confusion. With older children (I'm thinking 7 to 10 year olds) you can run a brightly coloured cord from the tent to the latrine area, and depending on the environment, you could leave a couple of night lanterns at the tents (this has its drawbacks in attracting insects) Above that age, as long as they are sensible, just make sure they have some obvious signposting - natural features etc - which they can use to navigate back.

To get that much battery life, you'd need to do these things: Keep the GPS off as much as possible (i.e. use it no more that 5-6 times a day) Turn it off at night completely keep brightness to a minimum Disable all cellular antennas (may need to jailbreak to do this) remove unnecessary apps, especially anything that wants to run in the background turn it off during the day as much as possible So even with all that, you're looking at 2 days. What can you do beyond that? I think the simplest solution to get you the recharge you'd need is to buy an iPhone battery case - usually this is just an external Li-ion battery that plugs into your iPhone. These are pretty common, fairly light, and generally easy to use. They also have the advantage of often combining in a waterproof case (so you can take pictures even if it is raining). The limitation might be that it doesn't actually get you enough charges for what you want to do (a bazillion pictures are a lot!) I agree that hand-cranks and solar chargers are not nearly reliable enough. So the only other solution that I might consider is something that eats AA Li-ion disposable batteries (or if you feel environmentally friendly, the best AA rechargeables you can find) and spits out power via USB. Tekkeon makes a couple products that might be the right kind of thing (I've used one before that worked perfectly)... You might try this one .

1353,,How should I put out a campfire while away from civilization?,smothering on stony ground,"A large part of this falls down to planning as to where you build the fire in the first place. If you have got a natural water source nearby then build close to there which will give you an ample source of water to make sure the fire is doused. As an added measure, it also provides an easy source of water for putting out your fire if it starts to spread beyond where you intended. If not, then at least try to build your fire on a stony area away from foliage where the fire may spread more easily, or will have more material to spread out of control if it re-ignites. However, bear in mind these are just things that can help, they're not substitutes for properly ensuring a fire is dead before moving on.

When a car hts a moose, because their legs are so long, generally the moose's body slides across the hood and collides with the windshield and people. Combined with the larger weight of a moose compared to a deer or other wildlife, people are much less likely to survive an accident when their car hits a moose. So to decrease your chances of ""dying by moose"", drive more slowly (especially at night) in moose country, never drive sleepy, and have the best and cleanest headlights you can.

4346,,How to apply duct tape and mole skin to prevent blisters?,re-apply a larger piece,"Blisters are caused by friction. Your skin is not very slippery. Applying moleskin and duct-tape over a ""hot-spot"" adds a protective layer between your skin and shoe. Thus as your shoe slides, it rubs against the tape or mole-skin instead of your skin. Pointers: Use enough tape/mole-skin to cover an area larger than the hot-spot. If the hotspot is on the edge of your heel go ahead and wrap the tape up and around the side/bottom so it doesn't shift/move. (Duct tape, being cheaper than mole-skin is better for large area applications.) Cut mole-skin in a circle (or at the very least, round the corners) to prevent the corners from catching on socks, shoes, etc and peeling off. (With duct-tape, I usually just snip the corners off, since it tends to stick better.) Use tincture of benzoin (a sticky substance) to help the moleskin adhere better to your foot. If you just have a hot-spot, I find duct-tape works better since it is thinner, and provides a near-frictionless surface. If you already have a blister, mole-skin / mole-foam (thicker) is better especially if you cut a hole in the center and stick a dough-nut of mole-skin around the blister. The added thickness helps keep your shoe from rubbing the blister in the middle Things to be aware of: Moleskin, being thicker, can take up space in tight-fitting shoes, and shift the fit-problem / wear elsewhere. Some areas (between toes) it might be better to wrap the rubbing toe than the rubbed toe (personal preference). Using too SMALL of a piece of tape/other will result in it shifting, falling off, balling up, etc. In that case, just try to re-apply a larger piece.",re-apply a larger piece,0.105458364,1607,1630,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4346
4461,,How dangerous is it to fall 3 meters when lead climbing?,fall factor,"How dangerous is it to fall 3 meters when lead climbing? This depends a lot on the fall factor . Counterintuitively, the fall factor is higher, indicating a more dangerous fall, when you are near the beginning of a pitch. This is because there's less rope out, so there's less stretchiness. As Steed's comment points out, you're going to fall more than 6 m in this situation, not 3 m. After you get your first clip in, you may have a false sense of security; by the time you're reaching for the second clip (which is 6 m up in the situation you've described), you have enough rope out so that if you miss the clip and fall, you're going to hit the deck. Different falls can have different run-outs. A fall from an overhang is actually the safest, since you can't hit anything. Depending on the route, you could swing like a pendulum, or slide down a slab and get cheese-grater injuries. What protection equipment should be used. A helmet. If you're trad climbing, that's a whole different thing -- we'd be talking about a trad rack. What training exercises should be completed beforehand? Start by learning to give a lead belay, and practice doing that enough times so that you understand the whole process well. Learn by watching your climber while belaying. Discuss things verbally with your climber. Help your climber catch mistakes. Learn not to back-clip, z-clip, put your thumb through the biner, or back-step the rope. Spend some time at home practicing clipping efficiently in a variety of positions with a quickdraw hanging on a doorknob. If you do fall, absorb the impact against the wall with your legs, and don't grab the rope. Learn the steps involved when you get to the top of a sport climb. This is actually pretty complicated. There are some advantages to learning to lead in a gym. For example, the routes tend to be constructed so that the run-outs are very safe, there is no danger from rock-fall, and you don't have to worry about the quality of your anchors.",fall factor,0.074050121,83,94,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4461

Right now, the actions to be taken are more ""Reactive"". i.e, in case one feels the symptoms of AMS, then one can take a call of going down or camping at the current altitude to get acclimatized. As a thumb rule, if you climb higher, and sleep lower, your body should get adjusted to the altitude. Having said that, each person's response is different. Below are some of the points to consider: If anyone in your group is complaining of not-so-good sleep, it can be an indicator of acclimatization not being complete. Nausea, headache, dizziness, lack of coordination(ataxia) are some of the things that can give you pointers towards those who are yet to acclimatize or are already hit by a moderate to severe case of AMS. The best suggestion of moving towards a higher camp would be to judge the spirit and the Real health conditions of your group. The above mentioned points can be taken into mind before you take your call of sending people down or moving up the mountain. I would always suggest that you prepare your group to prevent AMS as much as possible. I'm pretty sure that you know the following set of points, but in the interest of the community, let me put them forth anyway. Hydrate. Drink 3-4 liters of water. The symptoms of dehydration and AMS are cunningly similiar: Headache, dizziness etc. Eat well. Keep your energy reserves up all the time. Climb high, sleep low. It's advisable not to gain more than 1000 vertical feet if you are going to sleep at the higher altitude. Take it easy. Do not rush up to higher altitudes. Higher the altitude, slower should be the progress made. This allows for body to get adjusted to thinner air. Avoid depressant drugs. These reduce the rate of breathing which in turn reduce the intake of oxygen. There are drugs like Diamox which help one to get acclimatized faster. Remember, this is not a cure to AMS.

5469,,How to pull one's partner from a crack/crevasse when skiing?,alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two,"First, see my comment above. Get some professional instruction. Seriously. To answer your points directly: Build a snow anchor, then transfer the load to your anchor. Holding your partner's weight for the entire duration of a self rescue would be a bad idea. Building an anchor is independent of what your partner is doing. Always build an anchor. On glaciers, you'll most likely build a deadman anchor with an ice axe. It's possible to do a deadman with a ski, but it's time consuming and probably impossible to do alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two just adds to the complexity. At a minimum, you'll need to be able to arrest the fall, build an anchor, transfer the load, check on your partner, build a haul system, and effect the rescue. Oh, and you'll be by yourself.

5662,,How precise is a pedometer for estimating on a backpacking trip?,less than 10%.,"Searching online I found lots of useful informations, like e.g. wiki says: The accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices. Typically, step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip). Although traditional step counters get affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day. This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work. Accuracy also depends on the step-length the user enters. Best pedometers are accurate to within ¬± 5% error. On medicinenet one can find an overview on the topic. A useful quote on the topic here is this: The accuracy of pedometers has been carefully studied because they are frequently used in studies and researchers demand to know if they are reliable and accurate. Research shows that pedometers tend to count steps more accurately at speeds greater than 3 miles per hour (mph) than at slower speeds. Accuracy can exceed 96% when speeds exceed 3 mph, whereas the accuracy drops to between 74% and 91% at speeds from 2 mph to 3 mph, and it drops even further to between 60% and 71% at speeds below 2 mph. The error has to do with the insensitivity of pedometers to detect steps when people shuffle or drag their feet at slow speeds. Detectable vertical movement of the hips is necessary for pedometers to work well. The two types of pedometers differ in terms of accuracy depending on your speed and your habits: Piezoelectric pedometers tend to be more sensitive than spring-levered at slower speeds and so they may be preferable for individuals who walk slowly. In addition, the tilt of the pedometer is critical for performance with spring-levered devices, but not so with piezoelectric devices (the piezoelectric mechanism is not position dependent). For example, a pedometer may tilt forward into the horizontal plane if an overweight individual with excess abdominal fat wears one on their waist. Tilt in a spring-levered pedometer can throw off the accuracy by as much as 20% at fast speeds and 60% at slow speeds. A piezoelectric pedometer does not have this tilt error except at the slowest speed (less than 2 mph), and the error is less than 10%. More infos and tests on specific pedometers are given on walking.com . I don't know if they compared to GPS data in the tests but I think GPS is always more accurate to measure your distance. These days you can find GPS watches so size/weight is not really a matter (but maybe the pricing).

This will give you a idea of how your kit fits and the difference in hiking with a full rucksack compared to a daysack to help you judge how far you should aim for. Most of your camping kit can be tested at home. For example I would definitely check you can put up your tent and light your stove before going on a trip. Getting it wrong at home is much better than doing it wrong in the wild. Ideally if time allows you could also do a short one/two night backpacking trip before your main trip. This will allow you to check your kit in action so to speak and will give you an idea of some of the small items you may have forgotten. Forgetting loo-roll for a 1 night trip is bad.

7344,,How can I tell if Chinese rock climbing gear is reliable?,access to the appropriate testing equipment,"While I'm not too familiar with this brand, a 2013 article on BackpackingLight (largely paywalled) discussed recent developments in canister stoves , most of which are now manufactured in Asia. I think some of the comments from that article, and a preceeding 2009 article discussing Chinese manufacturing of outdoor gear, may apply here as well. Manufacturing quality can range from very high to quite low. (Most high-quality Western brands are also coming out of Chinese factories now.) An OEM factory doing a ""few extra runs"" in the evening, or making cosmetic tweaks will likely produce goods that are still of decent quality. A factory that hasn't had direct contact with Western designers and is simply creating products that look similar is much more likely to have quality issues. One problem identified in the 2009 article was that the manufacturers may not be familiar with the design history, and thus not understand why certain decisions were made. (They also may not be familiar with the actual end use of the product.) This can result in cost-cutting decisions that also impact safety or performance, particularly with manufacturers that don't have in-house engineering talent. The 2013 article has a more optimistic view, noting some of the in-house Asian stoves makers are showing ""serious design and development work"". An example of this would be with the Chinese stove-manufacturer Fire Maple, which appears to have added skilled engineering talent to their company and is doing its own development. Returning to the ""GoodMakings"" company and their climbing hardware, I would be curious as to whether this company is an OEM for more well-known brands, as that suggests a better chance of manufacturing quality. (Someone with access to the appropriate testing equipment could likely order some of their items and run a few tests.) Now for the questionable bit. I see their helmet displays the UIAA Safety Label (the image on the back of the helmet), but am not able to find mention of this brand in the UIAA's database . This is worrisome, and suggests a possibility that the certificate markings may be ""purely decorative"". Edit: It appears the company is now a UIAA safety label holder, and has at least received certifications for some of its hardware. Based on descriptions of GM products listed on http://storrick.cnc.net/VerticalDevicesPage/VerticalHome.shtml GM may be an OEM for smaller western companies, now expanding under its own name.",access to the appropriate testing equipment,0.035158232,1742,1785,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7344

8378,,How can you safely set up a climbing anchor from above?,step by step,"First off, there's tons of information out there on various types of anchors, different ways to equalize and secure them. One book I'd recommend is How to Rock Climb . Different anchor types each have their pros and cons. The best way to learn to build solid anchors is to have a more experienced climber, particularly someone who knows the area, walk you through building an anchor step by step. Personally, I've been taught and often use two different methods for top roping, depending on how far away from the cliff edge I can place protection. Specific to top-roping, you have more time to place gear and double check everything. While there's often more stress in the system, you can also find more bomber placements and use sturdier rope, etc. In many places, two points of solid pro are just fine, but three is almost always better. One point should almost never be used, even if it's really solid, except perhaps in specialized situations. Anchor position and attaching the rope In both cases, the anchor should be long enough so at least the carabiners you're going to attach the top rope to are hanging over the edge. Many people use two locking carabiners facing opposite directions, as a just in case, though one burly locking carabiner is not unheard of. I've never had any specific issues building an anchor at the top of a cliff. If needed, I'll place an extra piece of pro to clip myself into, or use the same pro as the anchors. I make sure the anchor falls where I want, and test it from the top before I toss the rope down. Sometimes it helps to have someone below looking at the route to make sure you've got the right spot. They can also give the rope a good tug while you inspect the protection. Two/Three point cordelette anchor I use 7mm PowerCord cordelette that was about 25ft, tied together with a double fishermens. You can also use a webbing cordelette, or a piece of webbing tied with a waterknot. Loop the cordelette through your protection, and ensure the knot is not in the way. Then pull the strands between the pro with your fingers, until it looks about like the image below, draped towards where you want the rope to fall. Grab all three loops, and adjust left or right, until the force on each end feels balanced, then tie a figure 8 (or a figure 9) behind the loops. The pros of this method are its simplicity, and that any one strand or piece of pro could fail, and the failure wouldn't cause much change in the rope's position or exert a lot of stress. The con is that you're using essentially one rope and so there's a greater risk if something happened at or below the knot. Two/Three point anchor with static rope or webbing In some cases, you need a longer anchor than you can easily get with a cordelette. In these cases I'll use webbing or static rope. I often use two separate ropes here, which could be cordelettes or single strands. It's more difficult to equalize since you'll need to approximate where the ropes should meet before you fully tie off extra slack. The same basics apply though, and the upside is that although if one piece failed, there would likely be more change in the ropes position, there's overall more redundancy since the carabiners holding the rope go through the loops of both separate strands. In conclusion Neither of these methods are the best or end all be all of top rope anchors. There's always a few ways to set an anchor in a given spot. I'd love to hear others chime in with common top rope anchors they use, or hear critiques. One setup that is always difficult for me is top belay systems over water. As always, test your anchor, and double check yourself and your partner, before climbing or rappelling. Also, apologies on the images, since they are not mine and don't do the best job of showing an anchor over a near vertical cliff.",step by step,0.246556848,383,395,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8378

8468,,How far away should I hang my food with dry bag?,at least 15',"At least 60m away, and 5m high. I doubt that there is such a thing a bag that bears absolutely can't smell through. Bears and other animals with rhinariums (wet nose) not only smell better than humans, they smell in a different way, they can literally taste odours. A bears sense of smell is roughly 2100 times more sensitive than a humans. Even if you got a fancy odour-proof bag to stick your food in, the bear would still be able to smell the bag , which could be enough for it to want to come take a closer sniff. Up close, I doubt there's anything a bears nose couldn't penetrate. Your greasy hands that handled your food also handled the bag, a bear will be able to smell that, and will probably assume there will be more of that tasty smell inside the bag. There's not much you can do to prevent a bear from smelling your food, so you have to take measures to ensure that the bear isn't attracted towards your sleeping area. I live in bear country, and personally, I don't use any kind of fancy bag to hang my food (a plastic bag is good enough), I just make sure it's a good distance away from my tent, and hung at least 15' off the ground between two trees where there's no way a bear could reach it. In my opinion, it'd be better not to use a smell proof bag, I'd rather the bear was following his nose away from my tent site and kept distracted all night far away from where I was sleeping rather than not notice the cache and come sniffing around our tents in hopes there might be scraps. It's important to keep your cooking area, and toileting area a good 60m away from your tent as well.

You can get them with or without berries but I found berries were gobbled up faster! Peanuts, good all year except for early-mid spring as fledglings can choke on them, but especially in winter they attract both birds and squirrels (a peanut feeder will not outfox a squirrel, unless you buy a fancy one) Mixed seed - in a plastic feeder (which you can make out of an old bottle and a wooden skewer) will attract smaller birds like sparrows.

Suet coconuts, these are a massive favourite of little birds again we got plenty of them with these. Another favourite is leftovers especially bacon fat.

The most effective way to let moisture out is ventilation, unfortunately, that means holes big enough to let water in -e.g. cotton. With a rain coat, apart from wearing it open, Pit zips (zips under the arms) are a very effective way to get a lot of ventilation without letting too much water in (even some very good breathable jackets have them.). The extreme form of a well ventilated rain coat is an Umbrella :) . The alternate is what are known collectively as breathable fabrics that let water vapour though the fabric, but not water. Goretex is probably the most well known as it was the first to be widely commercialised (It came out of the NASA space program), but there are many others now. Choosing a fabric is really a trade off between breathability, water proofness, robustness, and cost. Choose three, accept the fourth. Goretex has different fabrics suited for different tasks, with different pricing. Humidity significantly affect how breathable a particular jacket is on a given day. If humidity is high and its warm, forget about staying dry, even the very best jacket will not breath enough and you might as well wear nylon (or nothing). If its cold and dry, even a cheap breathable jacket will breath well enough to keep you dry. If the outer layer has water build up on it, the jacket won't breath - new jackets have coating (DWR) that makes the water bead up and run off. In the end, some days you are just going to get wet, and the only thing you can do to stay dry is stay home. The more you spend, the fewer of these days you get.

If it were true, then Dock leaves, which contain Oxalic acid, would not be a remedy. The extremely fine syringe type hair of the Nettle breaks off easily and penetrates the skin. Within this hair is a stinging solution which is only 1% Formic acid. A 2% - 10% concentration is required for the acid to be an irritant. It is histamine and serotonin in the sting which cause the irritation. Dock leaf sap contains a natural antihistamine. If you rub too hard with the dock leaf, you will merely disturb the nettle sting in your skin and make it worse.

10467,,How much does body fat actually insulate you against the cold?,not a lot,"In humans not a lot. There are significant differences between blubber and fat. Though blubber is mostly made of fat it has very different composition to human fat. An animal with blubber also uses it in very different ways to the way a human uses fat. Fat in a human is an energy source, not insulation: (blubber)... can comprise up to 50% of the body mass of some marine mammals during some points in their lives, and can range from 2 inches (5 cm) thick in dolphins and smaller whales, to more than 12 inches (30 cm) thick in some bigger whales, such as right and bowhead whales. However, this is not indicative of larger whales' ability to retain heat better, as the thickness of a whale's blubber does not significantly affect heat loss. More indicative of a whale's ability to retain heat is the water and lipid concentration in blubber , as water reduces heat-retaining capacities, and lipid increases them.[2] Wikipedia Blubber is also rich in blood vessels (which the fat of a human isn't), these blood vessels adapt to temperature, this allows the animal(s) that have it to react to changes in temperature. So a whale, for example, can ""re-route"" blood to underneath the blubber when cold. In humans the blood is outside of the fat layer (on the skin). A constant supply of blood is required prevent frost bite (the skin dying). Marine mammals have other adaptations too, the have a relatively low surface area to mass (when compared to say a human). So they can retain their heat more efficiently in their large bodies. Humans have a large surface area to body mass. We're adapted to life in much warmer climates, having evolved originally in Africa. If it's really cold they also migrate into warmer waters, nursing mother wales do this. A bigger factor in influencing humans in extreme cold is how their body reacts when it drops below the ideal 37.5C temperature. Below this temperature human organs begin to shut down, vital ones like the brain, heart, liver, etc. When this happens it's called Hypothermia . A body temperature between 32C and 35C is mild hyperthermia. Below this is life threatening. An interesting case study is Gu√∞laugur Fri√∞√æ√≥rsson (an Icelandic fisherman involved in a ship wreck in the arctic ocean). He survived 6 hours in 5C water. When he got to land his core body temperature was 34C yet he showed limited signs of hypothermia. No one really understands how this process works as it's very rare but it appears some people have an ability to protect their vital organs even when their core body temperature drops below what would kill 99% of humans.

Brushes : Once you've got the solvent, get a few brushes and spray bottles. Make sure the bristles won't be dissolved by the solvent. Depending on the solvent, you'll probably need natural bristles. Metal might work, but it will cause much more wear on the historic site's structure. Brushes of different sizes and shapes are convenient if you've got an irregular surface, like natural rock. Spray bottles and water : Fill half your spray bottles with solvent, and half with water. Then take extra water with you because you need enough to really rinse the solvent off the site when you are done. Figure on 2-3 times as much water as solvent, maybe more. On site removal Test Patch : Now it's time to take the materials to the site. Test the chemical on a tiny, hidden patch first. Spray the spot, let it sit for 15-20 minutes (or longer if the chemical's instructions say to), then wash it off with water. If the chemical hasn't damaged or discolored anything, you can use it (cleaning dirt is OK). Make sure you read the label of the chemical. Now you are ready to start removing graffiti. Do No Harm : First (and MOST important), think about the spot where you are working. What is the graffiti covering? If it is near or on top of an older painting, leave it alone. Same goes for if it is near writing, fabric, or anything else other than the material you've tested. You will do too much damage removing the graffiti. An expert can clean a single layer of paint off another painting, but you don't have the tools or the knowledge to do so. Do not even try. If you've got any question about whether you can safely remove the paint, leave it. Even if it takes another 50 years, someone with the proper skills can deal with it later, but if you cause extra damage, you make their job much harder, or impossible. Scrub : If the paint is on a plain wall or surface, you can start removing it. Follow the instructions on the solvent. It will probably say to apply it, then leave it for about 10 minutes before removing it. The longer it sits, the better it dissolves the paint, and the less work you need to do. Scrub until the paint is gone. Rinse with the water as you go. Remove as much as is practical. There may still be flecks left, but they will be relatively faint.

11392,,How should I regulate hydration on long hikes in hot temprature?,carry as much as I could manage,"The amount of water you require can vary a lot depending on the conditions and your level of exertion and conditioning. Dehydration can affect your physical and mental performance quite quickly so it should be a high priority. Similarly, if you are hiking between water sources you need to make a careful judgement on how reliable those sources are. Can you be sure that you will find water where you expect to and will you have enough water to reach an alternative source if the intended one fails? Perspiration is an important way of regulating your body temperature so you want to look at ways to keep cool rather than directly stopping perspiration. Heat injuries are potentially fatal so you need to be especially careful when the ambient temperature feel hot even when resting. Two litres per day (including the water content of food) is often cited as the minimum required for survival but with heat and exertion this can go up a lot. Certainly two or three times this amount might not be unreasonable in some circumstances, also allowing some margin for safety. Making sure you have plenty to drink when you do have ready access to water, e.g. in the mornings and evenings. This will help a lot as you will be fully hydrated when you set out and should need less during the day. While you are walking it is best to drink when you are thirsty and as much as you feel you need, this is easier to achieve if you drink little and often. There isn't much point rationing water during a day as it will give you more benefit in your body than in a water bottle. You might want to save a small amount until you reach your next water source for morale reasons but there is no point setting yourself an arbitrary limit. Similarly, if water sources are uncertain it is best to err on the side of caution. In the conditions you describe I would carry as much as I could manage, bearing in mind that the weight will go down throughout the day as you drink and sweat. The best guide to how much you need will be experience. For example go on a walk in similar conditions, staying close to water sources or go for one day and take a full load made up with water and make a note of how much you use. Ultimately you need to balance the extra effort of carrying the water with the benefits of staying well hydrated in terms of comfort and performance as well as the risk of getting into more serious trouble. Also consider the temperature when you plan your route. What route will offer the most shade? How long will it take you to reach the next water source and can you comfortably make it in a single day? What if you get delayed or injured or the route is blocked? It may also be helpful to plan to rest during the hottest part of the day, even if that means starting a bit earlier or finishing a bit later.",carry as much as I could manage,0.095762201,1841,1872,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11392

The other way, that wont get you yelled at but its slower, is to quickly move aside that thin hot superficial layer with your foot and take your step. Next time you are at the beach give a look at the way the old lifeguards or the guys that set umbrellas and chairs walk on the hot sand. These are ok for walking, you cant really do that for running.

Quality is also a factor in amount of solids, some cover little. You are trying to do what is normally done for a patch but for the whole hull so it might end with cracks over the years. Since you opted for a final layer of waxed (you could have used all non waxed and sealed with PVA to allow curing) you will have to wait for full curing, and then cleaning the wax if you ever find you need to cover other scratches. You should see how thick is the gelcoat already on from the areas you sanded through it, but other than that you can't treat the old gelcoat as X thickness, you don't know how it was applied. If in good conditions you could always patch the bare spots with new gelcoat (non waxed) cover with PVA for proper curing, wash the PVA off and sand to feather-in the patches and go over the whole hull with a fine grit to eliminate scratches and prep it for a final coat of waxed (waxed over waxed to be sanded means a lot of time for curing and cleaning in between coats). Perfect surface preparation from the beginning and maybe even spraying would mean no need for sanding so no extra thickness to be applied and just allow for final polish. I probably would do 2 coats if I were to use a roller on perfectly prepped fiberglass surface (I don't brush gelcoat, no sanding on it), and I would be on the thick side, think that usually you are around 0.5mm for gelcoats, you are just getting UV protection. I would also eliminate all the gelcoat that there is, if nothing even just to be sure of what is underneath, it's quite a bit of work but if there was something hiding you are going to find it. Eliminate all the bondo (it's ok on a car, not on a boat... that thick not even on a car really...) and use proper fairing compound (or resin+microspheres) instead. Don't worry if it was polyester gelcoat over epoxy resin (formulated for that application), just for the gelcoat on an hull that is not constantly in the water adhesion will be ok (there was some testing done on that), but any repair will need to be fully cured and properly prepared (unless you are hotcoating over polyester resin). For a whole hull though gelcoat is a lot of work and you would get the same service from paint in a much easier way, it's not a repair where you are trying to match the existing finish after all. Paint requires its own maintenance, you will have to repaint at one point, and future repairs will need to take in account that there's paint on the hull but it's less work with good results.

The problem answering the question in a more straight forward manner you have waterfalls like victoria falls (pictured below) that would almost certainly result in a fatal fall if you were to go over, but the chance of flushing over even when on the edge of the waterfall are low because of the depth and flow at the lip. To Contrast here is huka falls, a waterfall that even hundreds of meters upstream you cannot safely cross because of the heavy currents and lack of exit points from the river. In general you should avoid any water crossing with any meaningful current; unless you have whitewater experience or you can maintain your footing, shin deep or less, the entire time. In an emergency type scenario ropes can be helpful to mitigate risks, but require careful application as they add complexity to a potentially dangerous situation. Again experience goes a long way.

Here is an interesting document describing sand filter design. While most of it is quite technical, looking at the engineering side, the first chapter provides a good overview. The general principle of a sand filter is that the sand forms a porous layer which contaminants (bacteria, organic matter, etc) cannot pass through. Instead, they get stuck to or between sand particles. The Schmutzdecke is formed primarily from filtered bacteria that then grow in the upper layers of the sand and helps provide additional filtration. The appearance and composition of the Schmutzdecke can vary widely and is dependent on the water being filtered. As for the gravel, I've been unable to find anything to confirm this but I don't believe it helps with purification as such. I believe it is mainly to help with flow rates and preventing the outflow being blocked with sand. As for other materials working in the same way, any porous material can have the same effect, but sand is cheap and easily packed into any shape. Ceramic water filters are another common type of filter that work on roughly similar principles.",any porous material can have the same effect,0.138230562,1007,1051,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15590

15742,,How to follow the movements of a player while remaining unnoticed?,Wait and move deliberately in his direction,"A couple of options work for what you're asking, however, depending on location, some may be easier to do than others. I'd successfully hidden in plain sight on many occasions, but only really have success using the ""Blend In"" method. Central Clue Location : An easy way to be able to observe all the puzzles is pick a central location for all the puzzles which has a position that would allow you to remain hidden. Those circular clothes racks at a shopping mall are good for this, as you can remain hidden and yet still able to see and hear around you. All the puzzle items would need to be in the area, but a well placed clothes rack will allow you to see/hear a great distance. Other options are available, with the key being that you need a hiding location near the final clues. *Side note: this would be better done at non-peak times, as someone hiding in a clothes rack might draw the wrong kind of attention. Crowed Location/Blend In: Now this method will require you practice this at times when you're not together. I'd suggest using a family member, which is something I have done in the past. Pick a busy location and time to play this game with your friend. (Think Black Friday Shopping Center) Bring a light jacket and turn it inside-out and tie it around your waist. Wear a baseball cap, but have it turned around. When the game starts, don the jacket after turning it right side in and turn your baseball cap forwards. You've successfully destroyed your friend's mental image of what you're wearing, but now you'll have to alter how you walk. Personally, I choose to take shorter more meandering strides as I'm a tall person. Hunching over can help with this. Since you're in a location with lots of distractions you'll be able to follow your friend from a slight distance. One thing to keep in mind is never make eye contact/look directly at your friend. A key to this is not to make ""sudden"" movements. Everything must be slow and deliberate. I've pickpocketed family members and planted notes doing this, even when they've been looking for me. I'm sure there are counter-terrorist tactic books that delve into this more. The focal point of this method is to go with the flow of the crowd. Anything you do that is contrary to the crowd will single you out. If your friend veers off suddenly, don't immediately follow. Wait and move deliberately in his direction, but with a ""target"" of something different. You'd be surprised how easy it is to blend in with the ""masses"" and people will overlook you. Constant Distraction: Using the above method of blending in, you can take this one step further and get other people involved to allow you to stay extremely close to your friend. Sequester random strangers to ask your friend questions. A easy example is to tell a sales associate that your friend is wanting to look at a certain item. As your friend is distracted by the sales person, you will be able to observe them closely. A dangerous/risky example would be to tell security at the mall/location you are at, that your friend has been acting strangely. Don't mention that he is your friend. Now this comes with some risks, mainly that if you involve security, you might end up in hot water yourself, but might be worth it, depending on how badly you want to win. Any outside source of distraction to your friend's ""search"" for you, will allow you to be close by, without being seen. I'd combine this with changing your appearance slightly for best results. Other Considerations: For all these to work well, your best bet is to stay out of his/her line of sight at all times and when/if you're in their line of sight, blend in with your environment. The same can be said if in the woods. However, in nature, one big difference is that there isn't as much movement in the woods. Movement should only be done when your friend isn't looking.

16217,,How should I prepare my body for prolonged exposure to heat?,"Nutrition, clothing, behavior, and practice","There are a few things that influence your body's ability to regulate heat. Nutrition, clothing, behavior, and practice are the big ones. Nutrition is important as far as making sure you're properly hydrated and are replete with electrolytes. It's possible to become dehydrated even while drinking enough water. To fix this, make sure you consume salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or others you can read about here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance . Clothing is important as well, and is easy to do incorrectly if you're unfamiliar with how. You've mentioned you're in a forest, which means you don't have to worry about providing your own shade. Focus on wearing lightweight clothing which allows ventilation. Generally, do not wear cotton. It will absorb several times its weight in water, allowing chafing while preventing your sweat from properly evaporating off your skin. The sweat must evaporate from your skin or a layer of clothing near your skin in order to cool you off; this is called evaporative cooling. Underclothing should also not be cotton, again due to chafing and because your groin is just about the warmest part of your body. Soaked cotton allows much less airflow than soaked wool or synthetics. Wool or wool blend socks are usually best at providing ventilation for your feet to reduce blisters and overheating. The baseball cap you mentioned before is probably also a bad idea, especially if it's cotton. A wide-brimmed hat capable of providing shade while still allowing ventilation is a much better idea. Your head generates a lot of heat, and must be allowed to properly reject it to the atmosphere in order to avoid overheating your brain. Behavior is a much more simple category for improvements. Stay in shade, move slowly, and move even more slowly if you start to feel hot. Do not hesitate to take a break in the shade. In fact, take a break before you feel like you need to. Don't wipe sweat away unless you must. The sweat must remain on your skin to be effective. If you're producing excess sweat to where you're dripping, it may make sense for comfort reasons to wipe it away, but you wouldn't want to keep, say, a towel with you to clear your brow every few seconds. Practice is even simpler. Exposing your body to heat while exercising will generally cause you to thermoregulate more effectively. Your body will produce more blood and vasodilate more readily, allowing the blood at the surface of your skin to ""donate"" larger amounts of heat to the air (if below 38 degrees) or to evaporating sweat (if between 38 and 100 degrees (I really hope you're not going anywhere over 100 degrees)). This is how you see people who live in the tropics or mediterranea go about their day comfortably without sweating like a northerner does. TL;DR: Wear a wide hat of non-cotton, wear non-cotton shirt/pants/underpants/socks, move slowly, take breaks, drink water, eat salts in moderation, and keep at it. One controversial piece of advice I'll throw out there that fits with the ""practice"" paragraph is if you live in a warm place, avoid air conditioning. Or, at least, use in moderation. If you want to get accustomed to 30+ degrees, make sure your AC is set to 25.

16272,,How do you tie in to the centre of a rope?,fixed loop,"The easiest way is to tie a fixed loop in the middle of the rope (figure 8, alpine butterfly, bowline on a bight, etc) and then clip the climber in to that loop using two locking carabiners. Two carabiners are used here in order to avoid the scenario of a single carabiner rotating into a cross-loaded orientation during a fall and failing as a result. However, my preferred method is to tie in directly to the rope, with no additional carabiners, using a bowline on a bight. This can be achieved by tied the knot using a long bight that can be passed over the climber's entire body instead of just being passed over the rest of the knot. This gives you a bowline on a bight tie-in with a very large loop, which you can feed back through the knot to reduce the size of the loop before climbing. You then need to expand the loop afterwards before untying. Those who don't know how to tie or visually inspect and verify a bowline on a bight should not attempt this, as incorrectly tying the knot can easily result in a knot (or lack thereof) that is of inadequate security or even completely insecure. Another method for those more familiar with the figure-8 is to tie a figure 8 loop in a bight, just in the rope, not yet attached to the climber, making the loop large enough to fit over the climber's entire body. Then tie this into the climber's harness using a cow hitch (AKA lark's foot or girth hitch), by passing the figure-8 loop though the tie-in loops and then over the climber's whole body. This gives you a cow hitch tie in (which alone is insecure) backed up with a figure-8. The backup 8 will initially be way to far down the rope, due to its loop initially having been tied large enough to fit over the climber's body, but you can easily feed rope through to snug the figure 8 down against the cow hitch. As with the bowline version, you need to feed rope back through the knot to expand it before you can untie. Edit: Images, as requested. Bowline on a bight: Incorrectly tying this knot can result in a knot that is inadequate or even completely insecure. Do not attempt this if you do not already know how to verify a complete bowline on a bight. Take a bight from the middle of the rope. Make a doubled turn about a metre from the end of the bight, with the standing end on the bottom of the turn. Feed the bight down through the tie-in loops from top to bottom. (Note: It is essential to get these two directions correct.) Pass the bight up through the turn, pull it all the way through, and pass it over your head. Bring the bight all the way down your back, and then step through it so it is hanging in front of you. Pull the bight through the knot until it tightens and forms the collar of a bowline, resulting in an bowline with an excessively large loop. Feed the excess loop through the nipping turn of the bowline. The result is a nice, tight bowline on a bight. In order to undo the knot, work backwards through these steps, feeding slack through the nipping turn to enlarge the bowline loop, and then pulling the collar out until you can step through it and pass it up your back and over your head. Note that you can tie this knot in the opposite orientation, making the turn with the standing end on the top, and instead passing the bight through your tie-in loops from bottom to top. You would then pass the bight over your body in the opposite direction, from feet to head. The important part is that the bight is passed through the turn in the correct direction, as getting the direction wrong will result in the bowline collapsing into a girth hitch, which alone is not appropriate as a tie-in knot. Girth hitch with figure-8 backup: Take a bight from the middle of the rope, and tie a figure-8 about a metre from its end. Feed the bight through your tie-in loops from the bottom up to the top. Pass the bight over your head, down your back, and then step back through it. Pull it tight, and you now have a girth hitch with a figure-8 backup that is a long way back up the rope from the girth hitch. Feed the rope between the girth hitch and figure-8 through the figure 8 to bring the two knots close together. Pull the figure-8 snug, and you now have a girth hitch neatly backed up with a figure-8. To untie, reverse the steps, moving the figure-8 up the rope until you can loosed the girth hitch enough to be able to step through the bight and pass it up your back and over your head.",fixed loop,0.124877274,28,38,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16272
16810,,"How rare is resistance to poison ivy, and does resistance increase?",25%.,"The poison ivy plant itself is not what makes people itch. It's an oil called urushiol , which is inside the leaves, stems and roots of the plants. That's why some of the sources I quote below use the word urushiol, as that's the technical term for what causes the reaction. Most of the research I found indicates that between 15% and 25% of people are resistant to the effects of poison ivy. This source puts the number at 15%: Have you ever wondered: Can I get poison ivy? What you're really asking is: Am I allergic to the plant? Not everyone is. Up to 85% of Americans are allergic to poison ivy, leaving at least 15% resistant to any reaction. Dr. David Adams, a dermatologist at Penn State in Hershey, Pennsylvania, puts the resistant figure at around 25%. He's quoted in an article published in Science Daily in July, 2015: Three-quarters of the population will get an itchy red rash if exposed to the urushiol oil inside the plant's leaves, stem and roots. One-quarter of people will not have any reaction to exposure. Even if you were in the majority group who were allergic as a child, there is research to back up your experience of being less allergic, or even not allergic at all, now that you're older. From Understanding Poison Ivy Basics : Sensitivity to poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac varies from a mild to severe reaction, and may not cause any reaction at all the first time you're exposed. Some adults who reacted to poison ivy as children may find that they are now less sensitive. Some may even lose their sensitivity altogether. From Live Science : Question : I used to get poison ivy a lot when I was a kid. As an adult, I can't remember getting it. Do you develop an immunity to poison ivy? Answer : Most people have some level of sensitivity to toxic plants. It's the world's most common allergy. Sensitivity to poison ivy, oak and sumac tends to decline with age. People who got rashes as children usually see their sensitivity decrease by early adulthood. People who were once allergic to poison plants may even lose their sensitivity entirely later in life. It can go the other way too. From Myths About Poison Ivy : Myth : Once allergic, always allergic to poison ivy. Fact : A person's sensitivity to urushiol reaction changes over time, and even from season to season. People who were sensitive to poison ivy as children may not be allergic as adults and vice versa. From Medicinebow : Most of us are born into this world immune to poison ivy. But that can change at any time, even well into adult hood. When that happens, it almost always means that the allergy lasts for the rest of a lifetime. However, there are contrary claims: Some people who as a child suffered a severe rash allegedly develop immunity as adults.",25%.,0.138303131,758,762,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16810
17385,,How to get a beached pontoon boat back into the water?,physical effort,What constitutes ‚Äúbest and easiest?‚Äù I suspect you don‚Äôt want to pay for a proper boat lift to drive down to the beach and pick up the boat. If feasible that would be the best safety wise and easiest in terms of physical effort. I once watched a crew of Peruvian fishermen pull a beached fishing trawler all the way onto the shore. Like you suggested in your question with enough bodies pushing or pulling you could move the boat anywhere you want. If you don‚Äôt have the manpower and have plenty of time you can trench around and under the pontoons. Once the trenches are deep enough you can flood them and float the boat out. Depending on what lake this is and the regulations you might get in trouble for enacting your engineering project. Another option that might work is to load up the back end to try to lift the nose. Depending on the slope of the beach you might be able to swamp the back of the boat enough to get the nose free. Of course you might screw up systems that weren‚Äôt designed to be submerged or grind the back end of the pontoons against the lake bed causing damage and/or increased resistance. One final option would be to put a couple of old tires between one or both pontoons and the front bumper of your pickup truck. The tires will hopefully protect the boat and the truck as you use the truck to push the boat back in the water. After the most recent edit showed that some of my hare-brained schemes wouldn't work I cooked up another. What you can do is get a tall jack like a Hi-Lift that you can attach a sling to wrap around a pontoon. Additionally get a bunch of 4 inch ABS pipe (the black plastic pipe) that is cut to extend about 4 inches on each side of a single pontoon (roughly 16 to 20 inches). The idea is you jack up the boat and stick pipes under the pontoon. If the pipes will roll then it will be easy to push the boat into the water. If the pipes don't roll then it will offer a low friction surface that will make it easier than fighting the mud.,physical effort,0.039575987,212,227,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/17385

Rescuing a baby bird is a great thing! There are plenty of songbirds whose parents are fine if you touch their babies, which is good to know when rescuing. You did exactly the right thing in the right order. Young birds are especially susceptible to body temperature changes, so drying in the sun and protecting in the shade was perfect! Also, leaving it near to where you found it was very important. If it was fully formed but didn't have a lot of feathers, it was probably a nestling, who either fell out of the nest or was pushed out by another bird or predator. It's mainly helpless but a parent will usually look for it. If it had feathers and wings, but was unable to fly, it was probably a fledgling. They're ready to leave the nest (fledge), but need to learn life skills, like eating and flying. Depending on the breed, a parent will spend up to two weeks out of the nest teaching it. That parent will go quite far to find a separated one, like yours. Sometimes what we think is an orphan or lost bird is actually under the watchful eye of a nearby parent. At our last house we had a pool, and we found young birds in there way too often. Some say those birds aren't falling, they're going in purposely because they see their reflection in the water and think they're about to meet up with another bird! My husband would gently scoop it out either with his hands or a pool net. We'd sit on the ground with it, get a paper towel and gently pat it down until its feathers started to fluff up. If it was tipping over, we kept it on the ground between our feet, up against a lawn chair, or in a bed of paper towels while it got its bearings. Once dry, if it still couldn't stand, we'd prop it up gently under a tree with a cutout cardboard tent. It gave shade and protection, but left room open in case it was able to fly out, or a parent came to get it. Sometimes once they were dry and got over the shock, they would fly a little bit at a time, and finally over our fence and away! Sadly, sometimes they would pass away, and I would cry, but know we had done our best. Sometimes my husband would find one already deceased in the water and never even tell me about it because it made me too sad! I'm really glad your bird was re-claimed by its parents!

Sometimes it is not the size but the contrast that will make you stand out like sore thumb. If you are stranded in winter and everything is covert with snow you are better off with black smoke rather than white. Although I don't know what plants could produce black smoke.

Listening - I've found slightly over-inflating (and sitting on it, if possible, to give some extra pressure) and just listening for the leak works surprisingly well.

One online resource with pictures is at Backpacker Magazine . The basic steps (that are detailed there) are: Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (which you should do with any sprain, wherever you are) Bandage reasonably tightly - not so tight that you cut off circulation, but tight enough that you restrict swelling and support the ankle. A visual check to make sure the toes aren't turning blue is essential, especially in a very cold environment! Pad the ankle - a scarf, t-shirt or other material helps to make sure the ankle bones are protected. While you can use a branch, a much better option, and the one Backpacker Magazine recommends, is to use a foam sleeping mat as a splint, as it provides support and some impact protection. You can fold it in half, place it down one side of the leg, under the foot and up the other side. If it is too big, cut it - you can always buy another one once you get home. Use your usual mat ties or straps to hold it tight. Once you have got it secure and the ankle is immobilised without it being too tight, and you are confident that it won't be damaged further, take ibuprofen to help kill the pain and reduce inflammation.

Similarly if some paths may not be usable due to high rivers/flooding. Probably check with locals before walking if it looks like this might be an issue. As for actual equipment: Raincoat that is actually waterproof . If its going to be raining all day you don't want a rubbish raincoat, especially if it is cold too. I'd recommend you just spend the money and and get a good one, but if you don't mind getting a bit damp, plastic poncho like things are not bad. Waterproof trousers . Similarly getting wet is bad, waterproof trousers are good. Try and get ones with long zips that go at least up to the knees (preferably higher) This makes it much easier to put them on when it starts raining without taking your boots off. Sensible walking trousers ( quick dry ) . Most hiking type trousers are quick dry and dry in ~5mins. This is important when there is a short shower and you don't want to get your waterproofs out or you get wet anyway. Whatever you do, do not wear jeans hiking: they are very heavy when wet and take ages to dry. Dry bags/bin liners . These are to put the rest of your clothes/other kit in to keep dry while hiking. A few medium size dry bags are good as they allow you to divide your kit up easily. Black bin liners are definitely the cheaper option though. Another option or additionally you may want a bag cover (these often come with hiking rucksacks). I've found these to be less effective. Also make sure your bag cover is well attached to your rucksack. I've seen someone's blow off in the wind, resulting in them chasing it across a field. This was amusing for me at least. Survival bag/blanket. You should probably carry one of these anyway. I've seen two main types - the silver space blanket type ones and the orange plastic bodybag type. The silver ones are significantly lighter and smaller but can degrade over time if not stored properly. The orange ones also have the advantage that you can cut a hole in the bottom and make an emergency poncho rather than just wrap it around you. Survival shelter/tarp/tent . Something you can shelter in if needed. If you're not camping, you probably don't want a tent. A tarp is definitely the cheaper option. Make sure you know how to set it up though. Also not so good if it's blowing a gale. Survival shelters ( like this ) are very good even if the weather is really bad and are an actual piece of emergency equipment I would recommend. Washing line/string/thin rope . Basically you want something to make a washing line so you can dry any wet clothes easily.

7031,,How to achieve a climbing anchor that can withstand an upward load?,a small cam,"Are my fears of the anchor pieces popping out justified? Yes. This is an especially big concern when the climber has already placed the first piece of pro above the anchor, but falls before getting a second piece in. The fall factor can be large, and the direction of pull is up. If you don't have any gear that can hold against an upward pull, then your anchor isn't an anchor in this situation. Additionally, there is very rarely an option to place a nut to protect against an upward force. My experience is fairly limited, but in my experience it's not true that there is very rarely such an option. There should be, and there usually is. If you're on a well known rock-climbing route, then the route should have belay stations where it is possible to place adequate protection. If the belays were inherently unsafe, then hopefully nobody would have published a route description that told you to use those belays. It may take some ingenuity to find an appropriate placement. It may be more difficult to do with only passive gear, although in long-established areas like Tahquitz, the routes predate SLCDs, so it should be possible to slot a nut somewhere. Take some time and look around for placements. In recent memory, I recall a lot of cases where the piece that protected against an upward pull was a small cam. If you're using passive gear, then you probably need to place two pieces in opposition, one above the other. Then you tension them against each other, e.g., with clove hitches on a sling.

There are generally two schools of thought on skin tracks. The steeper the better Slow and steady wins the race Since you used ""effective"" rather than possible, my 2 cents would be that you should set the steepest skin track that allows you to climb at a consistent rate. If the track is so steep that you are stopping to rest every 10 steps, you will gain elevation slowly. There is also a school of thought that says your uptrack should be as beautiful as your tracks descending. This school tends to smooth transitions and lower climb angles. They view zig-zag kick turns as the method of last resort. A great source for tips from the Steeper is Better school is the website SteepChuter.com website The exact angle that will be 'too steep' on any given day is far too dependent on conditions and equipment to pick any numeric values. Generally it's somewhere between 20 and 30 degrees. A good rule of thumb is that if it's too steep to skin straight up, you should start thinking about avalanche hazard. As to when booting up is a more efficient means, this depends a lot snow conditions and how heavy your skis are. If the snow is hard and icy, crampons can be faster on even relatively flat slopes. I often use just crampons for early morning starts in spring corn snow ski season. Booting up is generally only used in soft snow conditions when the terrain doesn't allow a zig-zag skin track.

9926,,How many miles of hiking trails are there in the United States?,115,"This is impossible to answer unless you are willing to do an enormous amount of research. There is no single, or even just a few, databases of trails in the US. The national trail lists generally only contain the larger multi-state trails (like the AT, PCT, etc) and some of the larger regional trails, but these are the tip of the iceberg. I'm guessing, but the total length of trails is likely 100s if not over 1000 times more. For example, here in Massachusetts, we have the AT running thru the western end of the state, and some locally well-known regional trails, like the Bay Circuit, Midstate, and M&M trails. Look around on some national lists and see how many of the regional ones are listed at all. Then consider that the bulk of trails in MA are actually much shorter trails in individual towns. The Midstate Trail runs north/south thru MA, connecting NH and RI, and is 95 miles long. Here in Groton alone, we have over 115 miles of trails, and that's just one town. Groton may have a larger trail system than most, but even if the average is only 25 miles per town, that still dwarfs the lengths of the national and regional trails in MA. However, you're very unlikely to find more than a tiny fraction of these local trails listed anywhere nationally. This state of affairs is slowly changing, but even that is happening piecemeal at the local, regional, and state levels. A comprehensive national database is decades away at best. Even an MA state-wide database is years away. There have been individual efforts, but none comprehensive yet, although there is at least some talk about that. DCR (the MA Dept of Conservation and Recreation, owners of the state parks and forests) has now just within the last couple of years compiled a list of trails on their properties. Some of the regional planning agencies have tried to compile lists of trails within their regions. For example, the Montechusett region (roughly north central MA) has a region-wide trails map, but that doesn't contain every last trail in all the towns. It's also too low resolution to make that practical anyway. Groton does have a comprehensive map of all trails in town, but no really definitive measure of all their lengths. Our claim of 115 miles is an estimate based on reasonable assumptions, but not on comprehensive accurate measurements. I'm on the town Trails Committee and am actually working on that. I'm going around measuring all our trails with a measuring wheel, and taking GPS tracks at the same time. I'll eventually get to all of them, but that will probably be another 2-3 years out. And, even if I say so myself, we're well ahead of most towns in the state. Most don't have Trails Committees, so local land trusts and other private organizations and ""friends of ..."" groups maintain their specific trails, with not even a town-wide website, master list, or any one group responsible for such things. The reason I'm telling you all this detail is to put the problem in perspective. To get a complete list of trails in MA, you'd have to gather information from several federal and state agencies, dozens of local land trusts, and various other official, private, and volunteer groups in each of the 351 towns and cities.

If the injury is on the bone, you should immobilize the joints distal (further from the core of the body) and proximal (closer to the core of the body) to the injury. If the injury is on the joint, you should immobilize the bones distal and proximal to the injury. The idea is to prevent movement at the site of the injury by immobilizing the limb around it. Before splinting Fracture types If there is a fracture, determine if the fracture is closed or compound, and check for angulation. A closed fracture is one where the bone does not break the skin; a compound fracture is when the bone has broken the skin. An angulated fracture is one where the bone is no longer straight. A compound fracture will almost always be the result of an angulated fracture, but a closed fracture can also be angulated and is at risk of becoming open. An angulated fracture can pinch nerves or blood vessels, resulting in intense pain at the fracture, reduced sensation distal to the injury, and loss of circulation. Therefore, it is recommended to apply traction in line (TIL) if possible. TIL involves pulling slowly but firmly to separate the bones at the point of the fracture, then returning the limb to its anatomical position. If you meet resistance, do not force it. It can sometimes take a couple minutes of gentle traction. TIL should not be applied to a severely angulated or shattered bone. TIL can be used with arms and lower legs. A femur fracture is much more serious due to the potential for blood loss from the femoral artery. Once traction is applied to a fractured femur it must not be removed until the patient reaches definitive care, and therefore requires a traction splint. Traction splints are difficult to improvise in the field, and there is some disagreement among wilderness medicine educators on whether traction splints should be applied as first aid. Wound treatment Once traction has been applied if necessary/possible, treat any cuts or bleeding around the injury as you would for any other soft tissue injury. If there is an open fracture, it's imperative to thoroughly clean the wound to avoid infection, especially if your evacuation is likely to take a long time. Infection management is often overlooked in first aid, and a little time taken to thoroughly clean and dress a wound up front will pay dividends later. If any portion of bone is still exposed, cover it with a sterile dressing, ideally moistened with iodine solution, and take extra care to thoroughly pad around the bone when building the splint later. Patient assessment This is somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but patient care extends far beyond just fixing the most obvious problem. Make sure to check the patient for any other injuries ‚Äì an obvious and painful injury like a broken bone can distract the patient from less obvious but potentially threatening injuries. Learn the patient assessment system, monitor your patient's vital signs, and make sure you aren't overlooking any other problems. You also need to make sure to manage your patient's environment while treating their injuries. Don't get so focused on building a splint that you don't notice that your patient is shivering and rapidly progressing towards hypothermia. Getting on a pad, and under a tarp or in a tent before progressing to splinting is always a good idea. Splinting Arm splint Preparing materials After treating any wounds, you can now start building a splint. Remember that the splint should be comfortable, but also needs to completely immobilize above and below the point of injury. Make sure the patient's fingers remain accessible so that you can check their circulation and sensation after applying the splint. You will need a semi-solid structure to form the splint, as well as a lot of padding and wrapping materials. Arm splints and leg splints are generally approached differently, and you always have to improvise for the specific situation. I'll start by describing a standard arm splint. For almost any outing where I know I'll be more than an hour or two from definitive care I carry a SAM splint, which is a thin piece of aluminum covered by foam. The splint becomes very rigid when bent along the long axis to form a V, but is pliable enough when flat to conform to the shape of an arm and wrap around elbows. You can improvise with other materials ‚Äì try to find wide flat objects rather than small narrow objects like tent poles. For padding you can typically use extra clothes. Use the patient's clothes if they're available, because you probably won't get yours back! Fluffy items like fleece or down jackets are good ‚Äì they're comfortable, can conform to unusual shapes, and will also prevent the limb from getting cold (since it won't fit in a jacket very well once it's all splinted up!). For wrapping materials I usually carry a couple of ACE bandages in my first aid kit, but in a pinch you could tear up any stretchy fabric like a T-shirt. The wrapping material should be stretchy and wide, to distribute pressure evenly. Don't use cord, as it will apply pressure in a very narrow line, causing discomfort and possible reduction of circulation. You'll also need to fashion a sling. Triangle bandages (a.k.a. cravats) are commonly used for this, or can be improvised from a T-shirt or other materials. Building the splint Once you have your supplies ready, you can start building the splint. Size the SAM splint or other rigid material to the person's arm. You want the rigid material to cover the section you're immobilizing. For the forearm, you would put the splint up to the person's fingers and just below the elbow. For the elbow, you would place the elbow at a comfortable angle, then go from part way down the forearm to part way up the upper arm. You can use the patient's good arm to size the splint, assuming they're roughly symmetrical. Now get your padding prepared and fold it such that the SAM splint or other rigid material is covered and the excess padding is hanging off the long side. Gently place the splint on the bottom side of the arm, then wrap the excess padding around the top. If it doesn't go all the way around, or the padding seems too thin, add more. Make sure to use the padding to fill any gaps between the arm and the rigid material. Once the padding is in place, wrap the wrapping material around the entire splint bundle, proximal to distal (from near the body towards the fingers). Check with your patient as you go to ensure that the pressure feels comfortable. You don't want the limb to be to flex within the splint, but you also don't want to cut off circulation. You can check capillary refill in their fingernails by pressing on the whites and seeing how long it takes to recolorize in order to monitor circulation. The splint should now have that section secured. You next need to create a sling to fix the arm in place so it won't droop or swing around. Tie a knot at the tip of a triangular bandage. The knotted end should wrap around the elbow, and the long ends of the triangle should be drawn up around the shoulders and tied off behind the neck. For your patient's comfort, place some padding on their neck under the knot ‚Äì a spare hat or glove works well here. Finally, wrap a second sling around the person's torso (under the working armpit and around the disabled arm) to prevent the arm from swinging forward. Your patient should be able to stand up, lean forward, and rotate their torso without any movement of the disabled arm. Check again to ensure good circulation at the finger tips. Here's an example of a well-built full splint: Lower leg splint Splinting a lower leg fracture requires very similar supplies to an arm splint, with slight variations. The same principles of applying TIL and treating any soft tissue injuries apply. Rather than a smaller rigid material like a SAM splint, you can use a standard sleeping pad. In my opinion, the leg splint is a bit easier than the arm splint, but it's harder to explain with words ‚Äì see the photo below for step-by-step pictures, from this nice article from the wilderness medicine newsletter . You will need: A foam sleeping pad At least three (and preferably 5) pieces of webbing, cravats, or other wide material to wrap around the splint A longer piece of webbing, accessory cord, rope, or cravat to secure the bottom of the splint Lots of padding As with the arm splint, the padding should be used to fill any gaps between the pad and the leg. You should also remove the patient's shoes and socks to allow easy access to check circulation in their feet, but keep the socks handy so you can cover the tip of the toe when you don't need direct access ‚Äì don't want them to get hypothermia! The idea is to use the pad to form the rigid exterior of the splint, folding the end of the pad over the foot to form a secure bottom section: A patient with a leg fracture will typically be unable to walk without assistance. In the case of a closed inline fracture they may be able to walk, but this increases the risk of completely breaking the bone and causing a much worse angulated fracture. Litter evacuation is preferred for a fractured leg. I've written an answer about makeshift stretchers (which is really about why you should just wait for somebody with a real litter to arrive, but I digress). A word on equipment Wilderness medicine is all about being creative, and being selective in the tools you bring with you. It's possible to build a splint using bark from a tree, or your hiking poles, or any other of a number of objects. It's possible to make a wrap by cutting up a shirt. However, every minute you spend hunting around the forest for the right stick to make a crappy splint out of is another minute of daylight lost in what just became a much longer day for you. In more austere environments there may be no natural materials to use at all, and you may need every piece of gear you have. You asked for natural materials or common equipment, but I would implore you to make a few simple pieces of first aid equipment part of your common equipment. Especially when car camping, there is no excuse not to carry them. There are a number of relatively light-weight pieces of first aid equipment you can carry which can be used for many applications and will save you a lot of trouble if you need them. A sleeping pad, a SAM splint, a couple ACE wraps, a couple cravats, some coflex tape, and some gauze rolls are easy to carry and can be used to address almost any injury that you have a hope of addressing in the field. The further you are from definitive care and the less you can afford to tie up critical equipment in treating injuries, the more sense it makes to carry these simple pieces of equipment. All of these supplies can be purchased by anybody for very little cost. Final thoughts Splinting is a relatively simple yet effective way to improve patient outcomes in common wilderness injuries. However, it does take practice to build good splints ‚Äì you don't want to be learning for the first time when you or your buddy breaks an arm. At the very least you should practice these skills yourself, either at home or when you have some downtime around camp. You'll get a much better sense for what works well when you've both built and been in an improvised splint. If you're interested in becoming more prepared to deal with wilderness emergencies, take a wilderness medicine course. Wilderness First Aid is a 20ish hour course offered all over the US and other countries. You can take it over a weekend, often for under $200, and learn in detail how to build a splint and so much more. The 80ish hour Wilderness First Responder course is also offered in many places, can be taken over one week, and further expands your scope of care and confidence in responding to wilderness injuries. There's a lot which doesn't fit into the scope of this question which I would do if I were helping somebody with a fracture or sprain, starting with the patient assessment through all the steps of treating the injury and monitoring them during evacuation.

10151,,How to tell if it's safe to jump an obstacle on horseback?,walk around it and give it a once over,"Firstly, the best way to test if an obstacle (commonly called a jump) is safe to jump is to walk around it and give it a once over. This can be mounted or dismounted leading the horse. What you want to look for is holes or unevenness in the ground - usually caused from jumping in the wet and the ground drying with deep horse prints in. You also want to look at the quality of the jump, is the wood (log, or telegraph pole etc) splintered badly? If so a miscalculation in the horses jump could lead to a cut. Rotten jumps can also be an issue, but usually they should be fine. Also worth bearing in mind is if the jump has a clear line between height and floor, but this I referring to the fact that a single bar floating in the air is hard for a horse to gauge height and distance on. This is because horses do not calculate depth perception as a human does, so if the jump has no height reference for the horse they may catch and trip. Most cross country jumps or fences have a diagonal bar, or are completely solid. If the jump is excessively overgrown it is definitely worth checking by walking around it first as there can be hidden dangers in the over growth. For ditches and the like it is worth checking, one how deep any water maybe, especially if it is dirty as you cannot tell how deep it is, and two how degraded the far side is. Horses can panic in a situation like this if they slip. Most of the time a drop jump will be fine (imagine flat vertical drops cut into a small hill and jumping down them) but it's worth checking if the ground is slippery or waterlogged before descending. Take into account the surroundings and anything that may cause your horse to be skittish or refuse the jump, you don't want to get thrown off into anything unpleasant or dangerous. As for cross country jumping, this will depend. It is safe to assume if you're on a regularly maintained course then the jumps will have been maintained. If you're out on a hack and simply happen across one, I would follow the above and look for signs of degradation in the jump, and check the terrain before jumping. Bear in mind... many jumps, fallen logs, fences etc that are not held in place by wings are often very solid! I once had a refusal at a telegraph pole jump and was dragged backwards over it smacking my jaw.",walk around it and give it a once over,0.217079982,92,130,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10151

12965,,How to avoid tangling up the rope when throwing it before rappelling?,flake it into at least four separate coils,"Toss the middle first. Throwing your rope isn't always the best solution. High winds, trees, and rocky slopes can make it easy for you to get your rope hung up. Throwing your rope is only really advisable if you're on a steep vertical cliff and there's little or no risk of getting your rope hung up on anything. When you do throw your rope though, it's best to flake it into at least four separate coils; two coils for each strand. Coil the middle, then coil the end of each strand. When you throw, throw one strand at a time. For each strand, throw out the middle coil first, then throw the end after, this way you can better direct where you want your rope to go. In situations where you don't expect you can throw the rope without making a mess, then it's best to let your rope out as you go down. Flake your rope out into a sling on your side as shown below: http://www.climbing.com/skills/learn-this-alpine-rope-management/ Alternatively, you can descend with a rope bucket dangling off the haul loop of your harness.

13303,,How far does a nursing Eastern Gray squirrel travel from her nest?,I can't say exactly,"As you suspect, that squirrel in your yard is most likely an Eastern Gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis . Although they used to be primarily considered an American species, they're naturalized in many countries, and are commonly seen in Europe, especially Great Britain. Since she nests primarily in large trees, it makes sense that you've been seeing the mother feeding near your biggest trees. As to how far she travels from the nest, I can't say exactly. However, according to the Animal Diversity Organization at the University of Michigan, she has something called a Home Range, (described by some sources as approximately 2.5 acres), which she decreases while she's caring for her babies: Home ranges are generally larger in the summer. Home range sizes are negatively correlated with squirrel density. Lactating females may decrease their home ranges by as much as 50%. Home ranges are used in the same sequence each day. Mama squirrel is very resourceful. As you said, the litter may have multiple fathers, none of whom stay once the babies are born. Since her young are in the nest for an average of seven weeks, frequently up to ten, before they're weaned and able to venture out on their own, she's a hard-working single parent! She nurses her babies for long periods of time, keeps them warm, and grooms them. To keep the nest clean she changes their bedding, and even ingests their excrement to prevent poisoning by parasites. In addition to all that, she has to protect the litter from a variety of predators waiting to raid the nest, some from above, others from below, and she has developed sophisticated tools for doing that. Two main behaviors are most frequently observed. When she leaves the nest for any period of time, she covers the babies over with grass, to make them less visible, and therefore less vulnerable. She frequently builds two nests at the same time, and, if under imminent danger, will move her young. From New York Wild : If a mother squirrel perceives a threat to her babies in a nest, she will grab them one by one by the scruff of the neck, and trundle them to a new nest location which may be some distance away. A mother carrying her baby as she scurries along a telephone wire is a memorable sight! Research studies into squirrel sounds and their meanings are extensive and ongoing, so even though she absolutely has alarm calls, they're not always easy to understand. They depend on many factors, partly including the type and vicinity of the predator. Also, for the first several months after her youngsters are weaned, mom continues to do some surveillance, so her calls might be for protection of those that are independent but still in a maturation process. Some alert calls are used to warn other adult squirrels of the presence of danger, in case they'd prefer to stay away. Those are usually used in her territory but not near the nest. There appear to be three most frequently used alarm calls. Kuks are sharp dog-like barks, usually issued in a series Quaas are similar to kuks, but longer Moans are lower pitched, and resemble a whistle Other sounds are called chatter, rattle, muk muk, to name only a few, though they're not specifically indicative of danger. Tail movements are equally as important when communicating in general, and research shows that certain tail movement/vocalization combinations are likely to indicate danger. Sometimes she sounds an alarm from the nest. Other times, she purposely separates herself first, so it's hard to know whether or not she'd speak up if you got close. Squirrels are very smart, and also have a keen sense of smell, so if you seem like a curious passerby that doesn't smell like an animal, she's more likely to just sit on or at the nest. If you reach out to touch it, that would be a different story, but since that's not your intention, time spent watering or walking around your trees is probably not enough to cause her to make much noise.

13670,,How safe is a chest harness when used without a sit harness?,Never ever use a chest harness alone,"TLDR: Never ever use a chest harness alone. It depends on what you mean by effective: It can stop a fall, there was a time (before the seventies) when chest harnesses (alone) were used in mountaineering. The big problem comes after: suspension trauma. This is not limited to breast harnesses at all. This is the main life-threatening problem apart from direct mechanical injuries after a fall in climbing. Without movement the blood will get stuck in the lower extremities leading to orthostatic shock, leading to a circulatory collapse. According to Pit Schubert[1]: after only 2min hanging in a chest harness the arms are paralysed. This means you cannot rescue yourself anymore. According to Schubert hanging freely (in any kind of harness) is deadly after a maximum of 2h, potentially much earlier. So assuming on this trail you may be alone a chest harness can prove fatal in case of fall. Even if somebody arrives in time to save you (i.e. bring you into lying position before you are in shock) you will likely sustain damage to your arms/chest. In addition an operator using chest harnesses does not show off competence. You have to wonder whether safety is precarious in other regards as well. I would immediately stop using their services.

If the fuel in the canister becomes sufficiently warm the pressure can rupture the canister. Usually the bottom everts first, popping outwards, although I have heard of instances where this was immediately followed by it coming apart, so this should not be considered any form of early warning measure. At this point you have a few ounces of liquid butane that's rather far above its boiling point and suddenly under very little pressure, so it almost instantaneously transitions to gas and vapor. Such an event is called a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). Fire does not need be involved; in the referenced image above there are no signs of fire damage. If you are particularly unlucky, friction or sparks can ignite the cloud of vapor, possibly resulting in a fuel-air explosion. How to avoid it Don't park your car in the sun, or don't keep fuel canisters in it. However, on some trips this might be unavoidable. I suggest considering the following: For vehicles with a separate trunk, store the canisters in the trunk and not in the passenger compartment, which will be heated more due to the greenhouse effect of the windows. Find a way to insulate the canisters, such as placing them in an ice chest or wrapping them inside a blanket or sleeping bag. Depending on your area, caching them outside the vehicle may be considered. Of course, that also makes them more likely to grow legs and walk away.

Regardless, when storing: INSULATE. find some thermal wrap (like the tinfoil lined stuff) or layer tinfoil and paper with felt or cloth (and repeat a few times) as an insulator, and wrap it all around the saline bottle, with the hand heater in between. The more wraps, the better insulation, the longer it lasts in colder temps. That takes care of the cleaning component. The bigger thing is the storage case that they sit in overnight. Would not want to try and chip them out of ice blocks in the case in the AM.. but if that happens wear glasses for a few hours until it warms up. same thing though, since that is usually smaller than the saline bottle (and if you're going for up to a week one of the small bottles (4-6 oz) is FINE. don't haul more than you need.

Vinegar should kill the mould. Mould stains, but it can actually simply be dead mould and has been treated. Leave it for a few hours and let it just seep into the valve. Chlorine based cleaning products, such as the ones you use in bathrooms to remove the mould (kills and removes the stain) could , if you soaked it, remove the stain as well.

14830,,How much stronger is a vertical v-thread than a horizontal one?,significantly stronger,"TL;DR Vertical oriented V-threads (A-threads) are significantly stronger than horizontally aligned V-threads. The following numbers should not be taken at face value: Different test configurations were performed, but it is not clearly stated which are used to come up with these numbers. Tests by Beverly and Attaway showed an increase in mean failure load of 27% with standard deviation of 12%. Both are strong enough for abseiling (mean 11.3kN and 14.4kN, minimum 5.2kN and 10.9kN) but not suited as single anchor point for a belay. Experiment Description There were several experiments performed regarding rebored ice screws and ice screw angle (in case you wonder: positive angle is teeth pointing upwards). The here relevant experiments were sever slow pull tests on V- and A-threads. For reproducibility and ease of access, the tests were performed on lake ice (few tests on waterfall ice were done as well, but only in one configuration). Three to seven measurements per configuration were performed and the ice area included by the thread measured for each. The configuration varied not only by being horizontal or vertical, but also by the orientation of the thread. These variations were unfortunately not addressed in the discussion of the results. I can only assume, that they could not determine any significant differences. All these configuration seem to be evaluated to compare A- and V-threads. Results In general they found an expected, but nevertheless nice relation between the area surrounded by the thread (in the following just area) and failure load. As mentioned the comparison of V- to A-threads suffers from varying configurations and potential skewing by different mean areas. It can be assumed that these factors were simply failed to disclose, but were taken into account. The following values (all units kN) were obtained: [kN] V-thread A-thread mean: 11.3 14.4 std err: 0.8 0.7 min: 5.2 10.9 max: 16.8 17.5 This means that A-threads are about a forth stronger than V-threads. However looking at the 95% confidence interval of 1%-53% should make it clear that any claim more precise than ""A-thread is very likely stronger"" is rather adventurous. Discussion Both variants are suitable to use, but as vertical A-threads are stronger, it is advisable to use them. However they cannot be trusted as single anchor for multi-pitch climbing. Ropes are tested to not exceed 12kN in a UIAA fall, which can be assumed as worst case scenario. So a single A-thread may hold such a fall, but not reliably. Always back it up by a second thread or an ice screw. Source Many thanks to J. Marc Beverly and Stephen W.

14861,,How to keep away animals from my camp without setting a fire?,take measures,"I haven't seen any evidence that animals are kept away by a fire. This answer discusses that briefly. In general, wild animals in pristine backcountry areas tend to be wary of humans, simply because we're unfamiliar. Some animals, such as squirrels and bears, that live in heavily used areas can become dependent on human food, and they will then become habituated to humans. In areas like Yosemite Valley, these are animals that cruise the campgrounds nightly. They're certainly not staying away from campgrounds because there are fires. Wolf attacks are extremely rare in Europe. A study of wolf attacks states: ""Since wolves recolonised France in the late 1980's after almost a century of absence there have been no documented attacks on humans."" If you get an opportunity to see a wolf in the wild, you could celebrate it as a rare, once-in-a-lifetime experience to see an animal that has been driven almost to extinction. In times and places where wolf populations are less endangered, it appears that many attacks are by rabid wolves. I doubt that there is much you can do to deter a rabid animal. Note that many different animal species carry rabies, e.g., skunks and bats. Your most likely problems when dealing with wild animals are hassles, not attacks, and those hassles are likely to revolve around small animals and their attempts to get your food. To avoid those hassles, the most straightforward thing you can do is to take measures to prevent animals from getting access to your food, and to hide the smell of your food. For example, you can keep all your food sealed inside zip-lock bags, and you can hang your food from a tree or put it inside a hard-sided canister or a kevlar sack such as the ursack.",take measures,0.067033432,1434,1447,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14861
16758,,How high is too high for a spotter while spotting a climber?,irrelevant,"This varies a lot so it's hard to write a definitive answer. But if you're bouldering (full stop) and you think you're going to fall off (high in your grade) and your concerned about your landing, you want a spotter. Height is pretty much irrelevant. The spotters jobs include: Making sure you don't land on your head Ensuring you land on your feet Ensuring you land on the mats Moving the mats around so that they're under you shouting encouragement... Telling you they did it last week and it's easy, you're just doing it wrong This is just as relevant at 1m as it is at 6m. Remember a spotters job is not to catch you . They are there to ensure you land safely on the mats. This may mean they push you as you fall or flip you onto your feet but they should never try and actually catch you; this will likely just result in both the climber and spotter getting hurt. This doesn't mean you always need a spotter; they just add an extra dimension of safety. It's up to you to decide if you feel you want one or not. It's likely advisable if the landing is bad (not flat and/or covered in rocks, etc) or you're really pushing your grade and may have an uncontrolled fall. We seem to be getting into the realms of when does bouldering stop being bouldering and start free soloing. TBH I don't know, I don't think anyone does. It really depends on your own confidence. Personally I don't think I've climbed over 3m or so without a rope. If you're brave enough to climb higher than this with just mats then good luck. A spotter may help. Here's some advice form Climbing.com on spotting on high ball problems (emphasis my own): Never assume you‚Äôre being spotted and don‚Äôt be afraid to request one. As climbers, we‚Äôre responsible for our own safety . Spotting a super-highball can be dangerous, and the main goal for a spotter is to guide the falling climber onto the pads, not to catch her or slow her fall. Discuss the landing zone, how you might fall, and where the spotters should stand. As the climber falls, the spotter should aim to grasp her hips and fall with her toward the pads. With really big highballs, use a ‚Äúfloating pad‚Äù to cushion the impact: Two people hold a regular pad a few feet above the main pad layout, tracking underneath the climber and letting go when the climber hits this pad. The climber will hit the floating pad first, slowing her fall, before landing on the layered pads below. While spotting, keep fingers and thumbs together in a cupped position (spoons) as opposed to spread out (forks). This prevents finger and hand injury. With arms up, keep your elbows and knees slightly bent. Tl;Dr It's very subjective and you really need to make you own decision here but a spotter will help move the mats into the correct position if nothing else.",irrelevant,0.083476312,239,249,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16758

While both of these approaches theoretically allow for reassembly, they will almost certainly damage the tools body to some extent. Re-assembly would require either a precision sized high grade bolt OR equipment to replace a solid rivet ( This is NOT a blind/pop rivet ).

I'm not a bird expert by any means, and certainly not a crow expert. Everything I say is from this article; the only experience I have with crows is observing them in our neighborhood for years. So I can say from my observations that they are intelligent and cooperative. To summarize the article : Crows are social and accept adult and baby crows from outside their extended family. Baby crows need to learn foraging and predator avoidance from adult crows, and need to learn how to behave among other crows. Thus, my suggestion that you might adopt the crow as a pet would deny the crow his natural social life with other crows. Would you want to be adopted by a group of giant corvids, however well they fed you? It is, of course, better than starving or being killed by a predator, but is not ideal. The article states: Healthy crow fledglings can be introduced to any crow pod and will be accepted, fed and protected as one of their own. The article describes how to return the baby to its family or introduce it to potential adopter crows. Ideally, you should return the baby to the family of origin. Alternately, you can find another established pod of crows. To return a baby to its family or to ""foster"" it into a new family, follow these procedures: The best arrival time at the scene is early or late morning. The birds are active then, and you will want the baby to have the full day to get established and to get the number of feedings that it should have before dark. When you arrive at the site, hold the bird‚Äôs body gently in your hands leaving the wings free. Raise and lower the bird in your hands to encourage it to flap the wings. This will usually cause the baby to vocalize and will attract the attention of resident crows. The resident crows will respond right away to the bird's cries and come down to investigate. When you have the attention of the family, toss the baby into a tall thicket or into a tree. They usually land sideways and hang by one leg as if they are stranded. Don't panic. They right themselves in a few minutes and will shortly communicate with the other crows. The family will adopt the baby and all will be well. It seems from your question that you have observed that other crows are interested in this baby. Try this procedure, but watch what happens. If the crows adopt him, problem solved. If they reject him, you have a pet crow. You are part of nature, and I think it is admirable you are taking an interest in someone who might have died on your doorstep.",adopt the crow as a pet,0.073903143,665,688,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19514

See here for how to tie one. If I need more slack, I reach up and pull the prussik towards myself, if I need to go shorter I push it up towards the anchor. It is important that the loop with two strands goes to the climber , as otherwise, you won't be able to adjust the knot without climbing back to the anchor when it is fully extended. The other thing to note is that the double fishermans won't go through the prussik, so you want it as close to the side that goes to the anchor as possible but not directly on it. Finally, note that this s hould only be used with a cordelette made out of nylon cord and will not work with a cordelette made from dyspectra/dyneema or webbing as it will likely slip .

20347,,How does dental floss compare to fishing line in a survival situation?,low priority need,"When it comes to survival gear in wilderness scenarios, one needs to consider A) the utility of the equipment, and B) how difficult it is to find or craft the equipment from materials in the field. Using this framework to consider dental floss and fishing line as survival gear, the main uses that are difficult to craft in the field are as general-use low-impact rope, or as fishing line. In both cases tensile strength is important, and resistance to decay is another factor. Lastly, storage / weight is an important consideration. I presume fishing line easily surpasses floss in tensile strength, but it may not be as easy to store loads of it. I don't have data on this though, perhaps a better answer will come along with some. Anyway, given my experiences with bushcraft and minimalist camping, I would opt for fishing line as a more reliable substitute for rope than floss, and as a more adequate...fishing line...than floss. Think of what you need rope for: lashings of all kinds, providing a supporting surface to hang things from or rest things upon, stitching things in a pitch. In all those cases, I'd rather be working with fishing line than floss, as fishing line feels sturdier and less prone to fraying or decay. Then comes the use of line for actual fishing: safe to say fishing line would work better. As for dental hygiene, items which serve this function are relatively easy to find or craft in forests (yellow birch twigs is the local example which comes to mind), and in any case this is a low priority need in a survival situation.

Pay attention to how recently people appear to have been there, and if there are empty casings or target fragments on the ground. These will be a good sign to see whether other people have shot there. There are many unofficial established shooting spots in national forests that are used by many people and not publicized.

24622,,How to explain unexpected success following a bearing taken from an iPad,I cannot yet explain,"Let's address what you refer to as ""Grid declination"". Unfortunately, there are two competing definitions: First, the definition you are conforming to, is that it is the angle from grid north to magnetic north (see NR Can ) -- another name for which is grid-magnetic angle . A different definition is that it is the (generally very small) angle between true north and grid north (see free dictionary ) -- more commonly called grid convergence or meridian convergence . You are correct that a true bearing equals a magnetic bearing plus the magnetic declination -- assuming the declination is reckoned positive when magnetic north is east of true (and negative when west). You are also correct that different mapping systems, and different locations within those systems, will vary in where grid north is with respect to true (and hence magnetic) north. does the Web Mercator CRS happen to use the same Grid North ... NTS maps ...? No. NTS (Canada's topographic system) maps use the UTM -- a Transverse Mercator -- projection. This means that, depending on your latitude and how far from the central meridian you're at, you will have a grid convergence. In your location it is 17¬∞ 45.30' - 16¬∞ 17.04' = 1¬∞ 28.26' (using your numbers). On the other hand, the Web Mercator is a rectangular projection and all meridians are parallel and aligned with the grid, so there is zero grid convergence everywhere. You still need to correct for magnetic declination, however. I'm not yet clear whether you attempted to correct your survey bearings for the 18¬∞ magnetic declination. If you did correct your bearings for declination then you should expect the good results you got. If you did not correct for declination then there is something I cannot yet explain. To determine if there was magnetic interference from the iPad -- the result of which is known as magnetic deviation (see sailing issues ) -- why not try this: Using compass alone, and free from any possible magnetic interference, find the point on the horizon representing its magnetic north.

24631,,How to split 3-5 people into rope teams for glacier travel?,Roping up,"A bit later it states that during glacier travel, there should be a minimum of two rope teams. Is there any explanation why there should be 2 teams? The only case where this makes really sense is that a whole team falls into a crevasse. This must not happen under any circumstances. If the idea is that a second team can start the rescue immediately, this is a dangerous approach. After a crevasse fall has been stopped, it is paramount to build a reliable anchor (T-anchor or ice screw, depending on conditions) before anybody moves on untested terrain. A second team rushing to the rescue can easily cause a second fall into another crevasse nearby. Probably the perfect size for glacier travel is 3 persons. The chances of holding a fall in a 3 person team are sufficiently good and recovery of the fallen person is relatively easy with 2 persons at the top. On the other hand, the smaller the team the more agile. Every irregularity in your pace (either by terrain or irregular pace of the leader) will add with every person on the rope. This turns the last position of a team into a kind of stop and go (or rather stop and run) pace. 1 Considering this, for a 3 and 4 person team there is only one option which is going as a single team. For 5 persons there is the option of a single team as well, which is still ok as long as the terrain is rather regular [2]. If this is not the case or if the teams are preferring smaller teams and sufficient experience for the smaller teams, you can split this into a 3 person team on the front and a 2 person team behind. This combines the advantages of small teams with the benefit of a second team in case something goes horribly wrong. Note that in this case the second team has a tested trail and therefore the disadvantage of having only a second person for holding a fall is greatly diminished although not completely removed 1 For this reason it is often recommended to have the fittest members of your team towards the back and the weakest at the second or third positon. [2] A typical example of an irregular terrain is a crevasse zone where you have to change direction all the time. Keeping the rope taut all the time is more difficult with a bigger team. edit: On the concept of avalanche terrain and a second team digging the first team out. This is extremely wrong. Avalanche terrain is not the norm on a glacier. Most glaciers are quite flat most of the time and there is no risk of avalanches. If there is a realistic danger of avalanches and you cannot turn around or do not want to, the sensible thing is to keep a bigger distance between members (~50m). This has two positive effects. First, the snow is loaded less at a single point and the risk of triggering an avalanche is smaller (minimizing the risk). Second, in case of an avalanche only one person is affected (minimizing the damage). Roping up makes it impossible to keep a good distance and is a guarantee that the whole team is affected by an avalanche. (It has to be noted that in this situation you are likely in a spring ski tour where the glacier is snowed up properly and the risk of a crevasse fall is very small anyways) Avalanches can only be triggered in steeper terrain ( dry snow avalanches are most common on slopes between 30¬∞ and 45¬∞ ). In steep terrain a single member stumbling can pull the whole team with them if the snow is sufficiently hard. This is definitely a situation where you do not want to go roped (even though a lot of mountain guides have no issues short-roping 4 clients on an icy 35¬∞ slope...)",Roping up,0.020710668,2856,2865,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/24631
1,,How do I treat hot spots and blisters when I have no moleskin?,slow down,"The key is reducing friction. Duct tape can be a good preventative as long as you get it on before a blister forms. After the blister is there, it's harder to recommend as once you're ready to remove the duct tape, you might pull the blister along with it. Other options are to make sure you're wearing dry non-cotton socks. If you find your feet sweat a lot while walking, make sure you have good moisture wicking socks or you change your socks as the moisture builds up. Rotating socks gives one pair a chance to dry out while wearing the other. If you're in the middle of a hike and forming hotspots without any tape, extra socks or moleskin to help, you may have to just slow down.

9208,,How many miles per hour can a person travel a day on foot?,10,"I hike a lot in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and around here our 'book time' is based off of a book called the White Mountain Guide. It assumes that you will take half an hour for each horizontal mile and each 1,000 feet of elevation gain, so a 10 mile, 3,000 foot hike would take 6:30 by book time. This number can be useful for planning purposes, but it should never be taken literally; I'm far from the fastest hiker around, but on a good day and a decent trail I could beat book time by 30%, and of course there are many who could go much quicker. On the other hand, someone not in great shape or taking things slow could easily take longer than the book predicts. So personal ability is a huge variable in that regard. Terrain also matters considerably- on a fairly flat trail, 3 mph is a reasonable speed (50% faster than predicted!). On a particularly steep or rocky trail, you slow down considerably. There are instances where taking a longer trail with the same elevation gain will actually be faster because of the ease of navigating. Even with the fairly constrained context of trails in this one region, the variance is huge. And then we get to weather . Rain can definitely impede progress, but snow is the big kicker- if you end up postholing through thigh-deep snow, your speed could be well below 1 mph. On the other hand, if you have good traction and you're on a solid-packed trail, you can go faster than in the warm season (especially going downhill). Basically what I'm saying is that there are way too many variables to give you a reasonable estimate. If you set Scott Jurek (recent AT record-setter) down in Kansas on a nice day, he could probably do 60+ miles and feel good about it. Put some average person in that same area in a whiteout snowstorm and they'd probably struggle to make it from their front porch to the mailbox.

The other half of the time, I use slings to add extra length at one or more of the pieces of gear. If you're extremely confident that your gear placements are bomber, then you can get away with a somewhat wider angle between the different strands, which lets you get by with slightly less cord. If some of them are not that great, you can pamper them by lessening the angle to decrease the mechanical advantage, but that requires more cord.

So there is not much that differentiates them from each other, or to other friction hitches. The advantage of the prusik is the ""clean"" design: All strands are neatly position parallel to themselves, so it is easily inspected for correctness. For the Klemheist this is not the main criterion; there the loop must be on top and short, so that the wrappings below get squeezed tightly when loaded. This is not harder to tie, but certainly harder to inspect. This is mainly an issue in education; for self-checking, simulating a load situation while still secured is anyway the best option. One advantage of the Klemheist is that it can be used with both cords and slings, Prusik only with cords. Both knots excel at simplicity in design, but have some drawbacks compared to more sophisticated friction hitches. They block very well, but are hard to loosen after load. So they are good for backups, while for ascending a dedicated ascender device or more elaborate knots (the Fritz Bachmann variants of the discussed knots, the Prohaska, ...) are better suited.

14199,,How can I prevent a fiberglass crack in my sailboat from getting worse?,gelcoat,"Gelcoat cracking is pretty much a fact of life in boat ownership. The sun and water is a tough environment. However, gelcoat cracking is usually not too concerning as long as it is fixed right away. While you could probably get by for awhile just slathering some new gelcoat or epoxy over the crack, if there is any moisture trapped in the cracked area, you're going to make the problem worse. If you live in an area with a real winter and water freezes in the hull you're going to make it a lot worse. The short answer is to get one of those little fiberglass repair kits from your favorite boating retailer, and follow the directions in it. The only thing that will work well is a proper fiberglass repair, that's why they sell the kits. The basic process is to remove and sand away any compromised material, and build it back up with new material provided by the kit. In addition to the kit's directions, there are roughly a gazillion guides online about the subject. Interestingly enough, the kits usually don't include gelcoat, so you'll need to get some of that too. Epoxy's UV resistance is pretty lousy and unless you protect it with gelcoat or some other product you'll be back at square one in a few years. The kits usually use epoxy, which 15 years ago could have been a problem, as sunfishes (and many other boats) are made with polyester resin instead of epoxy, which doesn't bind together too well, but epoxies nowadays have supposedly made that problem a thing of the past. The fiberglass repair isn't terribly difficult, and unless you are trying to sell the boat and never sail again, I guarantee this won't be the last repair you ever make, so you might as well learn how it's done.",gelcoat,0.152758971,1142,1149,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14199

In your comment you mention maybe calibrating the altimeter three times a day, and also by as little as 40 feet. This seems like overkill to me. On a backpacking trip, we write down the altimeter reading when we stop for the day, and when we start for the day and maybe at the start and stop of a long break or flattish region if the weather looks like it is changing. If these notes are organized, it is easy to integrate mentally the changes caused by weather change rather than actual altitude change. (Yes, they are cumulative.) We calibrate the altimeter only when a significant change has accumulated -- 100 feet or so -- and when we are at a lake or pass or other benchmark. We don't feel we need to know the altitude with great accuracy on a step by step basis. As for what change is significant for forecasting the weather purposes, it depends on the precision and accuracy of your altimeter. For a long time we had an analog altimeter which could be read to 10 feet precision, but which was not accurate to 10 feet.

A gas leak can exclude oxygen to the point that you can no longer breathe, but there are standard mitigations: the gas canister is usually mounted external to the passenger cabin, in a compartment vented downwards, so that gas escaping a badly fitted connector will not enter the cabin. cookers typically have a safety cutoff that is heat operated, so if a flame blows out, the gas flow will stop. propane has a distinctive smell added, so it may wake you. while the main leak risk is from the connection to the canister, there is obviously a risk of leaks anywhere, so gas leak alarms are used Carbon monoxide poisoning is unfortunately a bit more likely. Carbon monoxide is typically a byproduct of burning a flame without enough oxygen, so the usual mitigation is to have a window open. Simple but effective. Like the propane detectors, carbon monoxide detectors will loudly warn you of a leak Fire (and explosion) is mitigated in the main by the cutoff and venting. When lighting a gas cooker, there is usually a requirement to hold the ignition until the flame has caught - and if the flame goes out, the cutoff will stop gas flow shortly afterwards. So the main fire risk when asleep is from leaving flames on - so checking all fire is out before going to bed is essential. No using the cooker as a heater when cold!

15792,,How do choices in design of a paddle-craft influence its handling characteristics?,in isolation,"Ay-yi-yi! This is a very broad question, a true answer to which would probably require a PhD in hydrodynamics or years of relevant engineering expertise. Note that the interplay between these design characteristics can be very complex and depend greatly on the exact conditions (flat water / waves / moving water / rapids / ..., skill of paddler, travel speed, ...). Furthermore, there are many, many, many other design characteristics that could be considered (freeboard / keel / bow shape / hydro-planing / ergonomics / ...), as well as considering that the hull shape varies over the length of the boat. All that being said, here's a very rough guideline. Reverse Engineering Much can be learned by comparing images of modern boats and considering the intended design. In comparing the general hull shapes, let's try to reverse engineer the design. A crewing scull is built to travel as fast as possible in a straight line over absolutely flat water. Stability is of minimal concern; all that matters is speed. Consider what can happen at even the Olympic level with a little bit of chop (or purportedly a blade snagging a piece of floating garbage). While there can be some very complex hull designs, a scull will generally have: a long narrow plan, a chined cross section, and very little rocker. Sea kayaks are generally built for covering long distances on reasonably flat water, generally with few course corrections. The paddler has some ability to provide active stabilization in a well fitting cockpit. A sea kayak generally has: a long narrow plan, a chined cross section, and a slight rocker. Canoes are also generally built for covering long distances on reasonably flat water, generally with few course corrections (note that there are whitewater canoes , which look very different).Passengers are located higher off the water in a canoe than in a sea kayak. Thus, a canoe has a higher center of gravity and lateral stability is more of a concern---passengers have less ability to provide active stabilization by shifting their weight. A canoe generally has: a long narrow plan (although wider than a sea kayak), a flat cross section, and some rocker. Whitewater kayaks . Whitewater kayaking requires frequent changes in direction, with much of the stability coming from the paddler actively balancing and maneuvering. Most of the forward movement comes from the current---actively paddling downstream is generally inefficient. Many designs are also built around surfing waves / playboating / whitewater rodeo . A whitewater kayak generally has: a short wide plan (often limited by leg length), either a flat bottom with hard chines or a gradually rounded bottom, and a lot of rocker. Now that we have a handful of actual boat shapes, let's look at each of this hull characteristics in turn. Assume that we are tweaking each of these parameters in isolation (i.e., all else being equal), along with many other disclaimers. Plan: A longer, narrower plan will generally result in less hydrodynamic drag (particularly dependent on the bow shape). It will also generally track straighter, but at the cost of reduced lateral stability and more difficulty turning. In comparison, a short wide plan would easier to turn and more stable, but give more drag and be slower. Cross Section: A flat bottom will provide the most lateral stability (and usable interior space), but will have a harder time tracking straight. It will also ""skid"" or ""pivot"" turns, unless actively tilted on edge. A rounded bottom will be easier to tip from side to side, which can be beneficial in a kayak. It will behave somewhere in between a flat bottom and a hard chine, depending on how rounded it is. The ""vee or hard chine"" cross section will generally track straight, as it has somewhat of a keel effect. This shape also has a secondary balance point when the boat is tipped on its side, allowing it to ""carve"" turns (this is how you turn a sea kayak, for example). On the flip side, this shape is difficult to turn in place. Rocker For rocker, we need to consider how much of the boat is in contact with the water (freeboard vs. beam, etc.). A more pronounced rocker will Be easier to turn (starts to emulate a short, wide plan if we look only at the portion of the hull in contact with the water). Be able to ride up and over waves as opposed to punching through them. Be more prone to ""planing""--rising up out of the water with increased speed.

18363,,How to land when jumping off a bouldering problem to minimize injury potential?,have good spotter,"There are two linked, but distinct issues: Preventing immediate injury and landing as ""softly"" as possible to prevent long term issues with joints/back/... The title tends to address the former, the body the latter, so I will address both. Also I only address the situation in a gym, i.e. mats all over the ground and no obstacles (I know, the people, but herding them away is the main job of a gym spotter). Direct injury All non-finger indoor bouldering injuries I had to witness affected arms/shoulders due to ""bad"" reflexes: Using the arms to ""catch"" the fall. This is not necessary with mats and spotters and it can very easily result in minor injuries, and major injuries are totally possible (like in permanent shoulder damage). The only thing arms should do is protect the head: Put your hands beside your head, which you pull forward towards your chest, such that elbows point away from your face (you can also interlace them behind your head/neck, but I doubt you do that while falling). The main point is: This is against your intuition/reflexes, so you need to train this, i.e. do it consciously on fake falls. Of course there is one blatant exception to this: If you fall literally directly upside down, you will want to use your arms because your neck is just quite a bit more valuable. However I have never seen a bouldering fall where no rotation is involved or anyone was unlucky enough to be in the vertical position of rolling. What exactly you do here I don't know, but I'd doubt you could do anything consciously in this scenario anyway. Photo by Patrick Matros in article Bouldern - Safety Basics by von Tanner Robert, Sch√§ffler Klaus and Matros Patrick published in bergundsteigen (#98) 1/17. If you fall +- flat face forward, there is another technique: Landing in a position similar to a plank: Arms at a right angle you can think of hitting the floor with your open palms and then the entire forearm. Head looking to the side, legs slightly spread and as much core tension as you can. The idea is absorb as much energy as you can and ideally keep your head entirely from the mat. Other than that, there is not much you can do on landing, but also not much injury potential. What you can do is have good spotter, but there are other questions for that. Soft falling First step is falling controlled vertically without much rotation. Obviously that isn't necessarily possible if you fall, but even then it makes sense to think about it: If you have a high crux move, also spend a thought on how you could fall and what position you will probably fall in, such that you can mentally prepare yourself (and maybe your spotter). In case you fall/jump controlled, the best way is to cut your feet loose, to hang straight down without swinging (obviously you might need to use your feet to stabilize yourself against the wall to stop any swinging). Photo by Klaus Sch√§ffler in article Bouldern - Safety Basics by von Tanner Robert, Sch√§ffler Klaus and Matros Patrick published in bergundsteigen (#98) 1/17. When falling get into a step position with your legs and, to get into the habit, put your arms besides your head as described above. On ground contact bend your knees and push backwards, such that you roll on your back (first ground contact at your hips). The point is not to keep standing, which puts pressure on all the usual long term suspects, from ankles over knees to your back. All the energy goes into rolling backwards. If there is a lot of energy and you want to be fancy, you may go into a roll backwards to get directly on your feet :D",have good spotter,0.184232906,2219,2236,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18363

19606,,How many days does it take to reach hiking X miles per day?,"80 days, so give yourself 11 weeks","There are a lot of factors, but for the Appalachian Trail there are a lot of hikers so it can give us pretty good insight into the time it takes for the average thru hiker to reach maximum mileage per day. Map Man (Steve Shuman) conducted an analysis of 240 successful north bound Appalachian Trial thru hikers who kept a journal (so not quite average, but I am not sure how keeping a journal affects mileage per day) from 2001 to 2010: https://www.whiteblaze.net/forum/content.php/44 He broke the trail into 11 unequal sections. The mileage per day was: 10.1, 12.0, 14.0, 15.9, 16.8, 16.8, 16.1, 15.5, 11.4, 12.5, 14.7, 14.7. It appears the mileage per day increases through the 5th section (up until Harpers Ferry), stays level until the 9th section which is the start of the White Mountains of NH. There are a number of reasons to expect the mileage to drop in NH (views, side trails, ruggedness of the trail, resupply options, limited camping). Some of the initial increase in mileage may be due to the terrain starting tough in Georgia and becoming gradually easier as you move through the Smokies. The analysis says the average hiker reaches Harpers Ferry in 80 days, so give yourself 11 weeks to hit peak mileage.","80 days, so give yourself 11 weeks",0.211400419,1165,1199,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19606
21197,,How do breathable fabrics like Gore-tex and DWR (Durable Water Repellent) work?,prevents the main outer layer from becoming wet,"In the absence of the DWR, it would still be waterproof, but not breathable. The DWR coating is to keep the rain off of the layer of Gore-tex but does not provide the waterproofing. Once the DWR coating wears off, the Gore-tex is no longer able to work and then the person's sweat starts building up inside and you will get wet from that. Early Gore-Tex fabric replaced the inner layer of PU with a thin, porous fluoropolymer membrane (Teflon) coating that is bonded to a fabric. This membrane had about 9 billion pores per square inch (around 1.4 billion pores per square centimeter). Each pore is approximately 1/20,000 the size of a water droplet, making it impenetrable to liquid water while still allowing the more volatile water vapour molecules to pass through. ... The DWR prevents the main outer layer from becoming wet, which would reduce the breathability of the whole fabric. However, the DWR is not responsible for the jacket being waterproof - this is a common misconception. Without the DWR, the outer layer would become soaked, there would be no breathability, and the wearer's sweat being produced on the inside would fail to evaporate, leading to dampness there .

21342,,How do you deal with blackberry bushes on the west coast when bushwhacking?,one-handed,"My absolute favorite tool for getting through blackberry canes is a serrated curved blade. There doesn't seem to be a great English name for this tool - it's sometimes called a Japanese gardening knife, gardening sickle, Japanese sickle, or similar. Getting through blackberries is still work - but this is the best way I've found, makes it easy to cut and move the canes one-handed. Best of all, the serrated blade can be used to grab and flick the canes without needing to grab them directly. After starting to cut my way in, I'll usually step on canes, and slice them off at the bottom. If they're especially large, the tool can be used to cut them smaller or move them out of the way. As they're cut, they'll tend to lay down, and you can walk over them. A huge mass of blackberry can originate from just a few canes in a small clump. It's not fast, but not painfully slow either. In a half-hour, you can make it a few hundred feet or so. I hesitate to bring this up since it's off-topic - but since nobody else has mentioned it - himalayan blackberry ( Rubus armeniacus ) is a nasty and common invasive plant in these parts.

21454,,How do you know you have reached North or South Pole without GPS?,If the elevation graph is flat,"I'll expand a bit on how one would use a sextant to locate the north or south pole. The basic arrangement needs a horizontal reflective plane, for which Amundsen used a pool of mercury. A precisely weighted mirror could work also, but a pool of mercury is more robust and doesn't go out of calibration. Sextant measures the angular distance between two visible objects, in this case between the sun and its reflection in the horizontal surface. This angle is twice the elevation of sun above the horizon. If you are standing at exactly the north (or south) pole, sun will remain at the same elevation all through the day. There will be a small linear change due to earth's orbit around the sun, but no cyclic 24-hour change because you are on the earths rotational axis. Now, you can take multiple measurements over the day and draw a graph. Even though sun remains at the same elevation, it will still move in a circle around you, so each measurement corresponds to a different direction. If the elevation graph is flat, you have found the pole. If it however resembles a sine wave, you can use the information to move closer to the pole. The direction where the sun's elevation is lowest is towards the pole, and the distance to the true pole can be calculated from the difference between lowest and highest elevation.",If the elevation graph is flat,0.138373375,990,1020,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21454

24849,,How do UIAA falls add up over time?/When to replace a rope,when it gets too stiff for comfortable handling,"I am sure there is no simple formula to add everything up as the load of a high factor fall is not increasing linearly. There have been experiments conducted by Pit Schubert in which he tested a rope with repeated falls on factor 0.35-0.45 on a rope rated to 5 falls with an 80 kilo mass. (Basically the norm just with a low fall factor) He reports that the rope lasted for more than 2 days of fall testing and broke after 220 falls. However, it was already stiff to unusability after 80 falls. (Source: Pit Schubert, Sicherheit und Risiko in Fels und Eis, page 64) What does this mean? The fall factor is relatively high for sports climbing falls. A factor of 0.4 would be a 4m fall from 10m height into a quick-draw at 8m. Your typical fall (especially at the gym) will likely be much smaller. The rope was fixed which means the fall was held completely static. In practice (belaying off the harness) there is always a dynamic catch, even with static devices like the GriGri. Loads in practice will be even lower. With the rope being fixed, there is always the same part of the rope in the carabiner that holds the fall. In practice, this would be distributed over a bigger part of the rope. As in all testing, this was performed using a metal weight to simulate the climber. A human climber's body will absorb some of the impact, therefore lowering the impact on the rope. Conclusion In practice, you will get a lot more than the 220 falls measured. Therefore, it should be impossible to break a rope simply by falling onto it, no matter how often you do. Check your equipment before climbing on it and if in doubt retire. Retire the rope when it gets too stiff for comfortable handling, or if it reaches the maximum life span given by the manufacturer.",when it gets too stiff for comfortable handling,0.080982767,1642,1689,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/24849

In April 2004 I flew Kathmandu-Lukla, and returned via bus from Jiri to Kathmandu. I remember the flight costing about a hundred dollars. My friend flew in September 2013, and he says it cost around $300. He says the price varies from day to day and season to season. Both he (recently) and I (then) booked the flight just a few days - no more than three - in advance after arriving in Kathmandu. On the way back, it took me five or six days to walk from Namche Bazaar to Jiri. Unlike the area from Lukla to the Everest Area (and the Gokyo area, which I also visited), the trail back to Jiri was relatively empty of tourists, though the Nepali villages were no less bustling. I was walking alone, but I didn't feel much of a risk. Of course feelings of danger are a very subjective thing, but that was my experience. After arriving in Jiri, I bought a local bus ticket back to Kathmandu in the evening, and took the morning bus, and arrived in Kathmandu that evening. Some caveats: This was during the civil war / Maoist rebellion. On one hand, that sounds a bit alarming, but the situation did not affect tourists that much (though I'm very glad for Nepal that it's over). The difference between the area above Lukla and between Lukla/Namche and Jiri was relatively extreme.

6854,,How should I choose between setting up a Cordelette or an Equalette climbing anchor?,Equalette,"I've had to deal with this question a lot teaching anchor building. When people have asked in the past I normally suggest they use the anchor you are most comfortable setting up, as they will both definitely work. That said, if we want to dive deeper into the rabbit hole, it's important to identify some distinct differences between them. Equalette : Typical top-rope setup on bolts or gear using a sewn-sling or cord. Characterized by carabiners on separate strands, most often with limiting knots to each side. Advantages over Cordelette: Anchor is self-equalizing (meaning if you pull the load 20 degrees to the left, it's still going to distribute the weight between the two points). Faster if pre-setup and tossed around your shoulder (when you get to the bolts at the end of a climb, attach one slide to each bolt and you're done). Stronger than cordelette if tied using a sewn-sling. Cordelette : Mostly now seen where an Equalette isn't. Characterized by a huge knot joining all connection points together. Advantages over Equalette: Just as easy to setup with 3, 4 or even 5 pieces of gear as it is with 2 (making it more versatile for trad anchors or suspect ice anchors). Cheaper than sewn-slings if you need to leave it behind. Faster to set up from scratch, and much much faster to re-rack when you're ready to take it down (often only one knot needs to be removed, and it's usually much bulkier and easier to untie). While discussions about anchors, (especially theoretical holding power), may rage on for generations to come, you can probably make some good rules of thumb by thinking about the most significant differences. For single-pitch climbing: use an Equalette setup whenever the route traverses significantly, and use a Cordellete when the route follows a direct line up. Additional reading: Lots of anchors variations exist - the Triplet , ACR , and Sliding X to name a few. They are all useful to know also. In a multi-pitch context, having a master point involving two carabiners is a major pain so the Equalette would be off the table for me. The more anchors you can tie, the more you can plug in what makes the most sense.

7011,,"How to prepare for a long rocky alpine route, which is unusual for me?",untie the rope only from one team member,"If I interpret your question correctly, your problem is not so much about the climbing itself but more about the strategy, i.e. to identify where to rope up and where to remove the rope again. As you say, this can cost you lots of time if you recognize those points too late. This isn't something that you can train by climbing but more a thing that should be part of your planning both at home and in the climb itself. Planning skills I guess you have some description or topo of the route you want to climb and don't just run up some undocumented piece of rock. As you plan your ascent, try to identify those stretches where you have to go roped and where you can leave the rope in your backpack. And even more important, identify points where it is good and safe to change between both. In the end, you should come up with a plan like rope up at the start of the ridge; climb roped for 10 pitches; then there's about 200m of steep grassy/rocky terrain to be scrambled; rope up again at a small plateau about ten meters below the start of the vertical crack... The general rule (unless one of the team is a trained mountain guide which learn some techniques for such cases) is that whenever you rope up the team members, you have to install some protection, otherwise a fall of one member will pull down the whole group. A second rule of thumb is that you better go some extra meters roped than having to do all the preparation stuff somewhere in steep terrain where you already are halfway into climbing and suddenly have to find a place to stand, build an anchor, and untangle your rope while you just have one hand free as you need the other to prevent a fall. The drawback of that rule is that for the leader it can be somewhat awkward to leave the steep climbing terrain into some more scrambling like terrain and finally don't find a spot to place a solid anchor to belay their second. This requires some experience to see such situations as they appear and is also the reason why it isn't quite easy to train such skills somewhere at home at a single-pitch route that you know by heart. The best training option I could imagine here would be to scramble into some unknown mixed terrain and try to figure out the places where you would start to rope up. Technical skills You did also mention that all the roping and unroping takes you quite long. You can try to add some technical training here, i.e. in terms of rope handling and organization, which can also be done at home. This includes for example unroping only as much as necessary: The team members should wear their harness and the stuff rigged there at least as long as there are still climbing passages to be done If the passage to go unroped is rather short, untie the rope only from one team member but let is tied to the harness of the other one and either have the rope wrapped up as ring-shaped package around their neck (cf. image below) or in their backpack.

7274,,How to check if a fence or cable has electricity without having special tools?,a COMPASS,"TL;DR - First try to identify if the wire is supposed to carry electricity (insulators on posts/wire goes to an electrical box/posted warning signs/ect...). There's really not much you can do to check the wire for current without a device aside from listening to it, touching it (potentially dangerous), or throwing something onto it that might react to a current (something wet/metallic/living/etc...). Maybe hold your arm close to see if your hairs stand up? If you have a compass , you may be able to use it to detect a magnetic field around the wire depending on the type and flow of electricity. These methods will only confirm that there is electricity in the wire, but without proper equipment, you can't really confirm a wire isn't charged, and you're operating under assumptions and risk shock by touching the wire. If you're asking how to identify an electric fence, the answer is that there will be insulators on the posts . Plain wire fences are just stapled or tied to the posts. Also, if the fence emits a powerful enough charge to hurt you, there will be caution, warning, or danger signs posted. Insulator on steel post Insulator on wood post & electric gate with insulated handle. I've climbed over electric fences plenty of times, they use them out here to deter bears from getting into certain areas (like the local dump) and keep deer out of crop fields. First few times I climbed through one I felt nothing, so I thought it was turned off (I was a kid at the time). It wasn't until I was holding two wires wide apart so that my dog could get through and touched the back of my hand to the wire above it that I got shocked. The thing about being a human is that you're typically insulated against the ground to some degree because of the rubber soles of your boots. Electric fences only really work if you're grounded or touching more than one wire. Even if you do get shocked, it's meant to smart, not injure, at the very most you might get a little red burn. Electric fences don't use a constant current, they pulse, sending out shocks that don't feel too dissimilar to a shock from a BBQ sparker. Of course this is only true for fences designed to keep animals at bay, if you encounter an electric fence designed to keep humans out, they will typically have big signs indicating that they are charged and will hurt you. Razor wire at the top is another give-away. EDIT: In response to edit by OP. If you happen upon a cable that you might want to use for a crossing, first of all, use common sense . Ask yourself, ""Why is this cable here?"" Is it meant to carry electricity, or does it have some other purpose? Your number one priority is still to identify if it is an electrical cable or not. In my part of the world it's common to happen across a forestry cable car for crossing creeks or canyons: But they're typically a dead giveaway, the cables don't extend beyond the anchors, and there's a basket with pulley wheels. You are not going to be able to easily access high-power electrical cables, they're put high up on poles for a reason, and won't necessarily carry your weight. The biggest giveaway that a cable is carrying a lot of electricity is that it will hum. Every power cable I've been under in the backcountry is easy to hear especially if it's raining or snowing. To be brief: there's not much you can do to safely detect electrical current in a wire without some sort of a device, but something that you may have on your person if you're in the woods, is a COMPASS which you could use to check for an electrical current. Hold the compass near the wire, the magnetic field will move the needle if there is a current in the wire.",a COMPASS,0.160393298,3494,3503,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7274

The two should climb simultaneously with the second tied in to a loop (Alpine Butterfly) about 5-10 meters above the third. If the difficulty is such the a fall is more than a remote possibility for either of the following climbers, or simultaneous climbing maintaining same separation is too difficult, they should not be belayed together and should climb separately. Simultaneous climbing is not for everyone, it adds difficultly and requires constant communication. Recovery from a fall is often a lot more difficult. By trying to jury rig a special case for a relatively (I hope) rarely used scenario, you are creating plenty opportunities for incorrect rigging. The rope management problems that could come from two climbers moving at different rates at different times, along with the need to lock off of the correct strand all make it what I would consider and unsafe set up (However, I personally believe any auto-locking set up unreliable and should only be used as a last resort or backup, never relied on as the primary safety measure)",The two should climb simultaneously with the second tied in to a loop,0.127371997,59,128,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7926

Traditional methods include canning, pickling, smoking/jerky, and dehydration. There are modern counterparts to all of these. Canned food is not a good choice if you're carrying the food on your backs. Dehydrated and freeze-dried foods are your best bet, combined with non-perishable items that you might normally eat. Foods like crackers, roasted nuts, dried fruit, chocolate, granola bars, etc. are good for uncooked quick meals. You can purchase dried milk which can be reconstituted with water and eaten with dry cereal. For hot meals items like rice, couscous, and pasta are common. There are many types of commercially available prepared meals which you just add hot water to. The key is to avoid anything which would go bad without refrigeration. I suspect that if you look around your pantry at home you'll find all kinds of items you regularly eat that keep well without refrigeration. Four days isn't very long, and even things like bread and fresh fruit will keep over that amount of time, though they may be heavier than you wish to carry. Regarding your modified question asking how to keep perishable items safe to eat... there really isn't any way to do that. If it's perishable, it needs refrigeration.

Obviously at 4 calories/gram, 70g of carbs will not supply 400-800 calories. The reasoning for this amount becomes more clear after further reading: ""For athletes engaged in high-intensity exercise for thirty to sixty minutes or longer, sport science recommends consuming thirty to seventy grams (120‚Äì280 calories) of carbohydrate per hour. This is based on numerous studies that suggest endurance athletes perform best ingesting 1.0‚Äì1.2 grams of carbohydrate per minute, which is the maximal oxidation rate of carbohydrate."" Regarding long days, the authors write, ""On a long all-day or multi-day effort you have to stick to conversational pace most of the time. In this case, plan to eat frequent small amounts of food balanced with carbohydrate/protein/fat such as a sandwich or wrap. Trail mix is also a nice balanced source of macronutrients. Gels and bars can work as well. Drink a bit every time you feed."" Your estimate of the total calories suggests a burn rate of 300-500 calories per hour, which is consistent with the low end of the range in that first quote, and makes sense for a less intense but longer duration effort. Keep in mind that a decent chunk of that number (at least half, if you're in good shape) will be supplied from fat rather than carbohydrate, and that the sort of endurance exercise you're doing will also increase the amount of protein that's being metabolized. Also, don't forget about electrolytes! I take this info to suggest that 60 or 70g of carbs can be considered an upper limit, and that the number can easily be dialed down since you need to keep to a reasonable pace. If there are portions of your trek where you do need to go all-out in terms of intensity, those would be the places to be downing 3-4 gels per hour.

8663,,How do I self-assess my physical condition after a fall in the backcountry?,At this point you've completed the primary assessment,"Self-assessment is difficult because your level of consciousness (LOC) may be impaired. Unfortunately, one's own state of mind is also very difficult to self-assess. I'll list here a brief overview of some of the ""self-checks"" you can do, but (as I'm sure you're already aware), getting a second person to check you out as soon as possible will help ensure you haven't missed anything. In situations where there may be nobody else nearby at all, it might not be a bad idea to carry a small checklist card with you, which you could refer back to and check things off as you assess yourself to make sure you don't forget anything if your LOC is reduced. In wilderness medicine we use the concept of the Patient Assessment System (PAS) as a standard way to check a patient and systematically identify possible problems. The full PAS could take a whole post of its own, or indeed most of an entire course. If this stuff is interesting to you, consider taking a wilderness first air or wilderness first responder course to really learn it in detail. The first step is to assess your immediate physical safety, i.e. a scene survey. In a self-assessment situation, the main thing you need to get out of a scene survey is whether or not it's safe to stay where you are. Just fell off some rocks? Are you at risk for further rockfall coming down on top of you, or is your current position at risk for falling further down the slope? If you need to move to eliminate possible life-threatening hazards (and you are physically capable of doing so), you should try to do so as soon as possible. After doing what you can to prevent any further injury, you go into a primary assessment, which can be remembered by the acronym ABCDE. The first two are less relevant in a self-assessment, but I'm including them because these go in order of priority, and it's good to know. If any issue is identified during the primary assessment, that's a ""stop-and-fix"" problem ‚Äì you deal with that before moving on to the next step. A irway: Is anything blocking your airway? In a self-assessment, this should be very obvious. B reathing: Again, obvious. If you aren't breathing, you probably aren't going to be assessing yourself in the first place. C irculation: Is your heart working? If you're checking yourself, probably. This is also the time to check for any major bleeding. Do a quick blood sweep ‚Äì run your hands over your body, checking to see if any blood appears. Sometimes serious wounds may not even hurt at first when you have adrenaline pumping and other injuries may be distracting you from the pain. Physically running your hands over your head, neck, arms, back, chest, legs, etc. and checking to see if any blood shows up is a good way to make sure you aren't missing something major. This step is very important in a self-assessment, because you can't see every inch of your body yourself. D eformity/disability: Is anything deformed or out of place? Are you at risk for permanent disability from a spinal injury? In considering whether a spinal injury may be a problem, there are various possible mechanisms of injury (MOI) which would lead one to suspect a possible spinal injury until proven otherwise. This includes a fall from >3x your body height (which occurred in your example), tumbling falls, sudden changes in movement (e.g. falling off a bike, crashing while skiing), falls directly onto the head or neck, and a variety of other causes. Standard procedure is to immobilize the spinal column when there's an MOI for a spinal injury, but it's near-impossible to keep your own neck still while inspecting yourself. If you do have to move your neck, make sure to do so very slowly, and if you meet any kind of resistance or pain when turning your head/neck, stop that motion. Regarding ""deformity"", this is where you do a ""chunk-check"" to see if anything else is out of place on your body. This part is a bit more difficult to do on yourself than to do on somebody else, but you can do it. The basic idea is to use your hands to quickly feel your body from head to toe (and finger), feeling for anything which is sticking out where it shouldn't be, or not sticking out where it should be. If something feels kinda weird, you can compare to the other side of your body to see if it's generally symmetrical or not. If you find any pain anywhere, try to take a closer look ‚Äì that's a spot where you may need to deal with something. Note that minor injuries found during the chunk-check don't need to be dealt with immediately. If you can, write them down so you don't forget. If it's an immediate threat to life, then you should stop-and-fix. E nvironment: The last part of the primary survey is to take note of your environment and protect yourself from the elements. Once you get too cold, it's very difficult ‚Äì especially when injured ‚Äì to warm back up. It's always a good idea to sit on a pad if you have one handy, put on some jackets and a hat, or if it's hot go sit in the shade. You need to take care of any environmental risks before proceeding to treat non-life-threatening problems such as sprains or small fractures. If you have some kind of portable shelter like a tarp or bivvy sack, now is a good time to get that out. If you fell into water, get dry before you develop hypothermia. Environmental emergencies like hypothermia and heat stroke are very preventable yet frequently complicate wilderness emergencies because it's easy to neglect. You should also take a moment to take care of your other bodily needs ‚Äì drink some water, eat a snack, and make sure all your bodily systems can run as well as possible, so you can focus on fixing any injuries. At this point you've completed the primary assessment. Standard procedure is to proceed into the secondary assessment, which consists of collecting vital signs, patient medical information, and performing a more detailed patient exam. At this point things get more complicated and more difficult to self-assess, so I would suggest looking at more detailed wilderness medicine resources if you're interested.

11407,,How to retrieve a bear bag when hung with Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) method,reverse the steps,"It seems like you simply need to reverse the procedure you give. Since you initially had to pull the rope up far enough to tie the stick in to it, you can still pull it back up to the same point in order to untie the stick. Then let the bag lower down again, stick free. Here is my hastily doodled interpretation of the process. The stick is represented by the red mark in each drawing. There is at each step, more rope than is required. At step 4, the cueball figure reaches up to tie the stick into the rope, but still leaves an ample amount of rope hanging at his feet. In step five he lowers the bag to this stick, then in step 6 he secures the loose rope around the tree trunk. To lower the bag, reverse the steps.

I suppose you could reproduce it ""in the wild"" hanging from a branch and a bag of stones. However that guy was an expert that forgot more than I'll ever know about bow building and didn't need to fiddle much with it to get things right. If you can build a bow I'm sure you can build a tillering stick and if it was so bad that you can't afford building a tillering stick you probably wouldn't be in position to bother about tiller too much anyways. By the way, at gathering you see some great builders that at first judge the bending against the ground, floor tillering, once happy with that they brace the bow and won't use anything else than pulling on the string and eyeballing down the limb. If you search for Richard Saffold that's an example of someone that does it. I was hoping for a video showing the whole process but the only video I was able to find its this, it's not that clear and he is centering the string but it gives the idea Richard Saffold: Tips for Tillering a Character Self Bow . I really doubt that primitive tribes used any tillering thingamajig or that the ones that still hunt with a bow for a living would find a tillering stick useful even to this day. I casually stumbled across this video on YouTube ""Batak Tribesman Shows How To Make A Quick Survival Bow And Arrow"" and you can see how he just flexes the stave.

Secondly: Two factors go together: Warranty period and ease of return, with greater weight being given to the latter. Check that if you buy it locally, you can return it locally. Features to consider: Is the cord flexible in the cold? Is there a way to fasten it in place so that larger birds won't move it or fly off with it. Is it at least not impossibly ugly.

15271,,"How do you pace yourself while doing strenuous hikes above 3,000 meters (10,000 feet)?",a heartbeat threshold,"Disclaimer: I usually climb up to 3000m or slightly beyond that. I use a heart rate monitor. My pace is set by a heartbeat threshold. I try not to exceed roughly 150bpm . If I exceed my aerobic threshold, I know that I am working harder than normal. This can be sustained for awhile, but not for too long, especially where the air is thinner. You actually get more health benefits if you keep your heart rate relatively low for the long haul. For estimating total time of ascent, I use 1 hour per 500 meters (if you are fit and used to altitude changes!) as a rule of thumb. Otherwise, you could adjust the h/m expectation to your fitness level/experience. This is based on a mostly vertical climb. It of course depends on the angle and how much horizontal terrain you need to cover. Where does 150bpm come from? It is the highest recommended bpm for aerobic respiration (cardiovascular) activity before you go anaerobic (muscles produce more lactic acid) for a male of 30 years of age. Obviously you need to know your body, because 150bpm is a rough estimate based on averages that do not take into account the many factors of your body. You can check the average for your age on various websites to get an idea of what your threshold might be.

15559,,How should I plan a backpacking trip with people who have never backpacked before?,"1 mile in, setup camp, 1 mile or less out arrangement","I can only tell you what I do, when I am in this situation. It's tricky, and getting everyone to agree can be tough, but it works. Take charge First, be the leader . Don't just suggest people bring x or y, make them. Assert control over the trip and make sure to keep it. Now that doesn't mean you have to be an ass hat, but you do need to ""take charge"". Make sure you it's clear that you're going and they are coming along. It's hard to describe, because I don't mean to suggest that you be overbearing. But for example, make sure that everyone checks their gear with you. Make sure that everyone checks their food with you. When people want to split off from the group make sure they know to check with you. Make sure they have you check their tent (or whatever) before they sleep in it. I know this seems silly, but your the one with experience. Be ready to suggest products and items that they will need to bring or buy. Be prepared to call the trip off if it's not going ""your way"" on a critical issue. Again, sounds bad. But if you say to bring drinking water, and someone is insisting they don't need to because you can just drink from the river, then you suggest that they get some kind of water purification system and they go ""no, river water should be fine"", you need to make the call and stop the trip. Where to go Next, choose a short trip . If it's their first time, then they may not be prepared for what hiking means. Specially if it's off trail. A 2-mile run on a track is a lot different then a 2-mile walk on a animal trail. I would suggest a 1 mile in, setup camp, 1 mile or less out arrangement. Yes, that means a lot of time at camp, but you don't want to be setting up a tent for the first time at dusk. And you really don't want to have to deal with muscle pain, back pain, sore feet, etc. on the way out. You want to leave them wanting more. Before the trip Third, have a planning day . Get everyone together for dinner or something and go over what the requirements are. Focus on shoes, packs, survival gear and food. Then, on the second half of planning day head to the stores. Get everything you don't have. Be ready to answer questions about weight, what is needed and what is nice to have. I usually have to remind people that why they want to take is what they will have to carry. That usually gets them to put down the big hibachi grill and choose something more reasonable. Then head to the grocery store. Get the food you want to take. Of course focus on lightweight high-energy foods. Be ready to explain your choices. Keep it simple. Canned food, beef maybe, fruits, nuts, and grains. Even though you may be comfortable preparing a lavish meal over a camp fire, it takes practice that they don't have. So stick with foods that are easy to cook, or don't require cooking. Remember to keep weight in mind. 10 pounds of steak sounds good, but remind them they they will have to carry it, and the ice to keep it edible. The day before the trip, have a packing day . Invite everyone over again, and have everyone help each other pack. Make sure you try to distribute weight. Even if it means mixing items. Women usually have to be stopped from bringing to many clothes. Men have a tendency to want to bring too many gadgets. Stick what you need to survive in one pile, and what you want to be comfortable in another. Make sure everyone has their ""survival gear"". (For example I think a first aid kit, some water purification tabs, a glow stick, a striker (fire starter), a compass, a knife, some rope, and toilet paper are survival gear). I would want everyone to carry that themselves. Yes, that means there 6 first aid kits. No one ever dies from too many bandages. (But again a small kit is all that's needed.) Then look at your comfort gear. Split it up so the weight is even. Get everyone into their pack, and have them walk around a bit and make sure they're ok with the weight and nothing is off-center. Starting out Once at the start of the trip, go over some safety info . Point out the ranger stations. Make sure everyone knows which way to walk and how to tell. Set up plans for being separated - both for the daytime and the nighttime. Go over the very basics: don't leave food about, keep your tent closed, keep clothes in your tent. Don't drink ""raw"" water. Go over what to do if someone is injured. Give everyone a map of the area you're hiking in and point out landmarks. See that big rock. That's this spot on the map. See that hill over there, here it is on the map. The river, that's this line right here. If you get lost, then you sit still and wait one hour. If no one finds you by then, you want to walk towards the river and then follow the bank to the big hill. You will either come the camp site or the ranger station. Camping Picking a campsite is easy; just make sure it's by a nice big landmark. If you're in a place with assigned camp sites then even better. Setting up camp make sure you get your spot set up first. If you're using a tent, get it up first. Then help the others with theirs if they ask. If it starts to get dark, it may be time to take charge again, but hopefully, you're with friends and you're not being an ass, so if they need help they will ask. In line with being a leader though, you make the call. If it looks like they're headed for a bad situation help them out. Better mad then dead (or injured, or sick). While camping stay on top of safety issues. Even if it means being a pest. Remind everyone to keep their food and trash away for example. Specially if you're in an area with bears, cougars, etc. Make it a point to turn in early. By now everyone should be following your lead as far as ""what needs doing"" so take advantage of that and turn in early. A little extra sleep will go along way. Fire , if they have had no experience, then you just manage the fire. Again it can really depend on where you are, but if you're in a ""dry"" area, it doesn't take much for a bad fire pit to become a dangerous situation. Last think you want is the rangers showing up because someone got silly with the fat wood. Give lessons, show the differences, but make sure they at least check with you before adding to the fire. It takes a while to know if a log will burn for an hour or all night. If you need more heat to cook or if you just need to wait for more of the wood to burn. First aid I know it's gonna be weird, but when you stop for the night, and in the morning before you pack up, make sure to do a medical check. Most importantly, make everyone take their shoes and socks off and check for blisters or irritations. These nasty little suckers can turn a 1 mile hike into a hospital trip, and because there seem only minor, people tend to just ""tough it out"", when all they really need to do is make someone aware of it, and put on a bandage (when it's early). Same is true for rubbing of pants and pack straps (though just ask don't look). If you catch it when its ""itchy"", a little water and a bandage will take care of it. If they wait till it's bleeding and hurts to walk.... Toilet It seems silly, but when setting up camp, when on site, and during your planning meeting make sure to go over it. Different parks have different rules. There not always intuitive or pleasant. HAVE FUN!!!! I know I talk a lot about you taking charge. But this trip is supposed to be fun. Keep it fun. Taking charge doesn't mean being bossy. But it does mean taking responsibility for the situation. Make sure it's fun and not just a day of you bossing everyone around. Help when needed, interject when needed, but mostly just chill and get back to nature.","1 mile in, setup camp, 1 mile or less out arrangement",0.122074097,1562,1615,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15559
16897,,How can I be sure that I'm ready to do the Three Peaks Challenge?,"Know your route, have a map and compass with you","All 3 main paths up Scafell Pike, Snowdon and Ben Nevis are well marked maintained and straight forward. I'd suggest anyone reasonably fit should be able to do anyone of these (up and down) in 3-4 hours (my fastest time up and down Snowdon is 2 hours). The hardest bit of the 3 peaks is the driving. Google thinks it's about a 10 hour drive so you're likely going to spend 9 hours walking and 10 hours driving. . Can you walk for 9 hours? Can you endure sitting in a car for 10?! :) I'd say this is possible for pretty much any fit and healthy person and 1000's complete it each year. But an increasingly large number are getting themselves into difficulty, mostly due to poor planning. Have a look though the various mountain rescue teams blogs and you'll see a lot of 3 peakers getting lost, etc. and having to be rescued by mountain rescue ( Llanberis MRT blog ). Many locals now dislike 3 peak teams due to some bad practices, always follow leave no trace ethics . Here's a brief checklist of what you should be prepared for/be aware of: I'd invest at least as much effort in the organisation side of the driving as I would in training for the walking. Be aware of daylight! Lots and lots of people get caught out by the sun going down. Know your route, have a map and compass with you. Make sure at least one member of your party is comfortable navigating in the hills potentially in the dark , especially this time of year (you've missed the longest days now). Injuries, carry a good first aid kit and be prepared to turn around if you need to. Parking, sounds silly but this time of year all 3 mountains are incredibly crowded. I know it's virtually impossible to park in Pen-Y-Pass (the closest car park to snowdon) pretty much any time of year. Ben Nevis is very remote and has very limited parking. So plan how you're going to get to the foot of the mountains. You may need to use public transport unless someone can drop you off and park further away. If you park badly expect a ticket (and possibly a shouting at from a disgruntled local) Plan toilet breaks. Don't defecate into the bushes, etc. For those interested a much more environmentally friendly version is the Yorkshire 3 peaks , no driving between the mountains. Just because the hills aren't as big doesn't make it easier BTW, I did this in training for the welsh 15 peaks ( more on my blog :) ) and it was pretty gruelling taking about 10 hours of solid walking.","Know your route, have a map and compass with you",0.02113021,1241,1289,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/16897

19795,,How to recover from muscle pain during the midst of a multi-day hiking?,rest,"First, lets talk briefly about the underlying issue, before addressing your specific question: If you get serious muscle pain (taking 5 days to go away is serious), you should adjust your hiking. Apart from the general measures, like adjusting distances and trying to get weight off your pack, for longer hikes like this you also need to think about rest days. In youth mountaineering courses I was taught a concept that's mainly geared towards injury prevention which loosely translates to ""mid-week-low"". It is pretty well observable, that in the middle of a longer trip there is an over-proportional decrease in the general disposition on that day, which also increases injury risk on it. If you are doing an activity for more than 5 days, a rest day is very important . A rest day doesn't mean you need to sit around all day, doing nothing but lying in the sun and maybe some stretching (though there is nothing wrong with that either), but you need to give your body a longer time of lower exertion. Maybe just do a much shorter distance that day, walking slower, taking time for extended rests. It doesn't really matter what you do, as long as it is a lot less intensive (and you enjoy it). Now that's all good and nice, but what do you do if you nevertheless are in the situation, where your muscles ache a lot. Sorry to disappoint, but once you are at this point, you likely wont get rid of the pain while continuing the hike. The only real remedy is rest. Massaging helps, either by yourself or from a potential hiking partner. If the aches are really bad, I personally don't stretch - it seems to make it worse. If you can shorten the distance, obviously adjust them down. Again what's important is prevention on the go : If you feel pain developing while walking, take a rest (i.e. before it gets bad). Massage and lightly stretch the muscle. Important: We are not talking about flexibility training here - you neither need to stretch very hard nor for a prolonged time, listen to the feedback your body provides. Then you need to adjust pace. I know it's hard, especially if you have a set goal and/or hiking partners, that get slowed down. There is no point ignoring the problem and then potentially having to abort the hike entirely. If they don't have any problems and have reserves, maybe you can off-load some of your weight - that goes a long way. It might take a bit of guts to ask (if they didn't offer already), but there's really no shame in it.

OK, people do rim-to-rims, but this is not recommended for anyone first visiting the canyon - even experienced hikers from other regions at the top of their game. The desert environment, coupled with the vast elevation loss (and gain) creates a hiking situation most people can't comprehend. Its the descent that really gets you: hiking down stairs for 7-9 miles (11-15km). The best description I have heard from a participant on my trips: "" Put on your boots, nail a 2x4 across the bottom of them, stick your feet up in the air, and have your friend pound on that 2x4 with a sledge-hammer for 6 hours. "" And regarding your last criteria (seeing things), between the pain, your heat exhaustion, dehydration, and the rush, you won't see anything along the way. 3&4. Set out even without a permit, clandestine camp, or show up at the campground : Aside being illegal, that is just plain rude. The permit system does not exist to ruin your vacation, but rather tries to maximize the number of people that can enjoy the resource without destroying the resource, OR destroying the experience of others. The main corridor is already the most highly-traveled place in the canyon. It is also one of the most well-patrolled regions of the canyon, so your presence would be noticed. If you are caught, you will be charged with a federal misdemeanor (Federal misdemeanors can carry fines of up to $5,000 and six months in jail.) As a 5th option, you can get permits to wild-camp in one of the neighboring zones. Wild-camping is allowed in different zones, and if you head east or west on the Tonto trail a mile or two, there might be more availability. However, those areas do not have ready access to water, or other amenities, so it is imperative you are experienced with desert back-country travel. A 6th option is to check the availability of rooms at Phantom Ranch located at the bottom of the canyon.","clandestine camp, or show up at the campground",0.151924685,1427,1473,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1154

This includes things like the care and feeding of the animal, as well as how to pack the animal properly to keep the load manageable and balanced.

Llamas are browsers, nibbling lots of plants rather than eating one patch down to the ground. Llama pellets tend to be less offensive to hikers than horse apples. Cons: You have something else to take care of during your trip (hassle) Llamas can be stubborn, and just sit in the middle of the trail far from your destination (kushing) - good luck getting them up again (a lot of this depends on the training they've received) They can go many places, but can't go everywhere, limiting your route options Many horses freak out if they meet a llama, and can cause wreaks in heavy horse-use areas where llamas are unfamiliar Transporting the llama requires a trailer or an additional fee from the renter",1/2 day,0.214861691,59,66,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8964
10716,,How do I get my fingers and toes warm before rock climbing at cold temperatures?,putting them inside your jacket,"Before the climb As @ShemSeger suggests, most of the work is to be done before the climb itself. You need to stay warm belaying your partner and waiting to climb yourself - if your hands and feet are cold beforehand, it will be hard to warm them up when they are in contact with cold stone. What you can do is: Keep your core warm by wearing warm clothes - down jacket is great. Don't forget a hat and a buff! Gloves are essential - keep your hands warm by wearing belaying gloves. If it gets really cold, skiing gloves are great! Just make sure they have enough grip to safely handle the rope while belaying. You can also consider putting hand warmers in your gloves. And so are warm socks . I usually take a pair of skiing socks with me if it's approaching 0¬∞C. Make sure you have comfortable and warm shoes on belay to allow blood blow in your feet. Keep moving to get the blood flowing ‚Äì run around, do jumping jacks ‚Äì whatever works! Move your fingers in the gloves and repeatedly open and close your hand to make sure a lot of warm blood is pumped through your forearms. Warm drinks also help, especially if you get cold already. Don't forget to eat if you stay outside longer ‚Äì you need a lot of energy to keep you warm and going! Chocolate helps. While climbing Try to move fast to the hard stuff - once you are really engaged in a challenging climb, it's really hard to get cold! While I'm a fan of warm-up routes in normal conditions, I found that they really do not help if it is really cold. On the contrary, they only make my hands and feet freeze off and the warming up effect is gone well before I am able to start the next climb. Try warming up on the ground wearing gloves all the time. If you really want to climb some easier stuff, try climbing in gloves. If you get a good rest position or a no-hand, warm your hands by touching the back of your neck . It is a really warm and easily accessible spot even if one hand needs to hold the rock. Other good spots are between tights and under armpits, but those require standing on a ledge or hanging into the rope. Try climbing with sock in your shoes. It might be uncomfortable, but I find a discomfort of a too small shoe much preferable to that of freezing-off toes. Climb in an older pair shoes or your alpine/multi-pitch shoes if you have some. I managed to fit skiing socks inside mine older shoes this autumn and it was really great! Attach gloves to your harness and take them with you - if your hands are approaching a state when you do not feel the holds anymore, hang on a rope and warm them up. You can also use them after falling off. I found that if you do that once, it almost always suffices for the reminder of a climb. Put a hand warmer in your chalk bag . After climbing Get dressed immediately! Even if you are warm right now, you'll get cold pretty soon. Employ the same techniques as before climbing. Keep your climbing shoes warm between the climbs by putting them inside your jacket. If you feel this characteristic pain of blood flowing again into really cold fingers and toes... some swearing helps, usually ;)",putting them inside your jacket,0.137128606,2940,2971,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10716
13315,,How should I clean epoxy out of the insert that goes in an arrow shaft?,acetic acid,"Heating can help, but you have to be careful, infact an ""insert removal tool"" is basically a brass bolt as tip of a soldering iron. However if you have a soldering iron with bent needle tip for electronics you will be able to work it only where you need running into the threads, you will clean it but its slow. Dental picks (metal ones) work too if you have them and if you have the patience, it takes time, more than with the soldering iron. What are the shafts made of? If they are carbon whatever chemical you use can also ruin the shaft if it goes on that. BTW acetic acid works well for cleaning epoxy, plain vinegar is enough but best the pickling one that is a tad more concentrated. Use acetone, MEK, or all that stuff only if you are sure it will stay within the threaded part, its much more aggressive than vinegar and it will ruin any plastic or carbon it comes in contact with (some people use it to clean carbon shafts, but it ruins them). There are tools made for cleaning and re-tap the inserts threads, or you can just use a normal tap of the right size from an hardware store , works the same, lasts forever, and since its not ""for archery"" costs less and will take any tap you will need to retap other parts of your bow if compound etc (or make your own cutting 3 grooves along the side of a metal bolt since it would be just for cleaning out an existing thread and not cutting a new one. The grooves are necessary to collect the waste to be cleaned out or it just gets packed at the end of the thread, obviously clean the burrs off the tap once cut the grooves). From the hardware store you will find 3 kind of taps, you want the ""bottoming"" ones, that will clean all the way down even on blind inserts Some inserts are sold with burrs, other times some points wont fit properly, so having a tool like that at hand is always useful. Otherwise just take everything apart, if necessary restore to length with a sleeve and rebuild compensating for the extra weight (but must be really messed up to do that). As prevention, beside immediately cleaning with vinegar where needed, you can protect the thread with a nylon bolt (hardware store) coated with vaseline before gluing, glue wont stick to it (you actually can ""cast"" inserts that way). Remove it when the glue is not fully cured (green) while holding the lip of the insert. If you dont find the nylon threaded bolt, or if you are worried it will get stuck and break inside the insert (in which case a drill bit held in the tap tool to practice a hole in the nylon will give room to the tap for cleaning the rest of the bolt off) just heavily coat the threads of the inserts with vaseline on qtip/toothpick (no vaseline? can use a crayon, grease pencil, lipstick, string wax, shoe polish... basically anything greasy that coats the threads wont let the epoxy stick to it, for the same reasons be careful to not smear it on parts that need to be glued, and that's also why its best to avoid oil) PS: If you want to buy the tool specific for archery be aware that some sold online are pretty much worthless. If you want to be sure the tool works for you, go to your store with the shaft and tell the person at the counter what you want and that you want to be sure it works, they will probably demonstrate it right there and then.

Of the samples from mineralized areas, those collected in gold-producing districts averaged 0.17 ppm compared with 0.12 ppm in non-gold-producing areas. The samples collected in Alaska averaged 0.34 ppm; this value corresponds closely with those obtained by War- ren and Delavault (1950) for Canadian samples. The difference in average content in plants growing on mineralized and unmineralized ground however, is not significant and suggests that Equisetum would not be useful in prospecting for gold. Silver is absorbed by Equisetum more readily than gold, and the amount of silver absorbed seems to be related to the amount of silver present in the soil.

Other preventative methods include using mosquito deterrents or repellents like citronella candles, torches, lanterns, etc. There are brands devoted to mosquito control like Thermacell who provide a plethora of products. Your next best solution is to control the mosquito population in your yard. Preventative methods work the best, by either eliminating breeding areas such as anything that can collect water (spare tires, buckets or pails, ditches that perpetually puddle, swampy areas, etc.), mosquitoes will breed wherever there is standing water. Some mosquitos lay eggs in grass too, keep your grass cut and don't let any areas of you yard get overgrown. Long grass is a haven for mosquitos because they can fly down where they have protection from sun and heat, and also often find water. Finally, you can treat your yard and kill all the mosquitos before they become a problem. Larvicide any pools, fountains, or ponds that you have in your yard. This kills 99% of the larvae before they mature. Malathion is most popular for killing mature mosquitos in your yard. You can get a bottle with a hose attachment and spray your yard, or you can get a fogger from pretty much any hardware store and fog your yard.

16521,,How far from a road do I need to be to not hear the traffic?,3.8 km,"The answer is it depends. Highway noise is typically 70-80 dB at 15 m. To a first order approximation, sound waves obey the inverse square law where there is a 6 dB drop every doubling of the distance. This means a sound source that has a level of 72 dB at 15 m would have a level of 0 dB at 60 km. While absolute threshold is typically described as 0 dB, highway noise probably becomes imperceptible from the forest background noise at 30 dB, or about 3.8 km from the highway under ideal conditions. The first order approximation is not very good. This book chapter seems to touch on the key factors meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity), terrain (e.g., hills and what is on the ground) and obstructions that will influence the propagation of the sound. Some of these things cause sound to get attenuated quicker while others can cause it to propagate further (e.g., a forest can act as a wave guide). If the vegetation is thick enough, it can provide substantial attenuation (10 dB per 61 m). Further, the inverse square law is for point sources and, as the linked chapter points out, highway noise is potentially better modeled as multiple point sources 9or maybe even a line source if there is lots of traffic).

It is a right in Scotland, where the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which was introduced in 2005, sets out the rights of access and the right to camp throughout Scotland. The Act established a legal right to wild camp anywhere in Scotland so long as campers follow a few guidelines. Camping must be lightweight, done in small numbers and only for two or three nights in one place. Campers must act responsibly, cause no pollution and leave no trace. In England and Wales there is no right to camp in the wild without the express permission of the landowner. There are some areas where wild camping is fairly common and tolerated. For example, in the Lake District and Snowdonia above the highest field boundaries, there are large areas where the camping is accepted, providing reasonable precautions are taken, and campers must be out of sight of all roads and human habitation. But it's still not a right. Dartmoor is a little different because you have a de facto right to camp and the national park does encourage responsible wild camping although some areas which are live firing ranges will have access restrictions at times when firing is planned. The advice is to camp high up, pitch late and strike camp early, and to definitely leave no trace. Early and late is best thought of as unusually early or late, when people are less likely to be around rather than at a fixed time, so use common sense depending on location.

19718,,How warm should a sleeping bag be to sleep in summer in the Alps comfortably?,20 degrees F,"Warnings and Caveats Everyone sleeps different. Some people sleep much warmer than others while others sleep incredibly cold. You can try and determine this in your house or better your backyard, but you really won't know until you are sleeping while hungry, exhausted and in the actual weather you are dealing with. Humidity effects people differently and so does altitude. The temperatures you have experience most recently also affect how you sleep. Just because you are a warm sleeper at -10 does not mean you will be a warm sleeper at +10. To be ultralight in a critical piece of gear like a sleeping bag means to know your body. There is nothing stopping you from buying an ultralight sleeping bag, but if you don't know how you sleep, you need to buy an ultralight bag with warmth to spare. Next, while I always want to be safe, I also want to be usually comfortable. Some areas have very consistent temperatures and the very rare incredibly cold night. In these areas I plan on being comfortable most nights and figuring out how to survive the once a season cold night (e.g., is it an area I can hike to lower elevation or the safety of town or can I do jumping jacks all night long). Other areas every night is essentially the coldest it gets. For these areas I never want to get close to the safety limit since I will never be comfortable. I would describe the Alps as being pretty consistent in temperature in the summer meaning you should expect to actually experience the extreme low on a regular basis. Can I safelly assume, that it will not get much below 0¬∞C in summer in the Alps at around 2000 meters altitude? The Alps are a big region, but that seems like a reasonable lower limit of expected temperatures. If I had did not have an escape plan, I would want to make sure my system would allow me to be safe, but slightly unconformable at that temperature. Lacking an escape plan, beyond get up and hike, I would probably want to sleep with all my cloths on and in a tent down to -10C. If I can check the weather and choose days and campsites, and don't mind canceling a trip because it is cold, 0C is probably fine as a low limit of sleeping safely. How much warmer will it be inside a tent? (very small two-person tent, two layers, no heaters) This depends on a number of factors (wind, tent, number of people, sleeping bags, etc. This blog post claims 20 degrees F, but I wouldn't count on that much of an improvement. It is also worth noting that sleeping bag ratings assume a pretty optimal tent. Sleeping bags have temperature ratings for three categories: comfort, limit and extreem. Should I look at the lowest value of ""comfort"" temperature if I want to be able to sleep without feeling cold? The EN 13537 standard has a lot of values. The extreme temperature is essentially the lowest temperature that an average women can survive. This is a very cold night. Even though women sleep colder than men, this is still a very cold night for a man. The Limit temperature applies to a man sleeping curled up and not feeling cold. This is by no means a comfortable night, but generally is far away from risks for the average man. If I was an average man and didn't have any thing but a light set of cloths, a tent, and a good sleeping pad, and had an escape plan, I would probably want the limit temperature to be around 0C. With a light weight puffy jacket, I might be willing to go warmer depending on how often cold nights happen. The Comfort temperature is for the average woman sleeping in a relaxed position and feeling comfortable.

19830,,How do songbirds and small animals know when there's a hawk in the immediate vicinity?,running on their short legs for cover,"All it takes is one of the birds to notice and give the alarm and then the other birds join in. Even the chipmunks and squirrel s will listen to the birds and then pass the message along. Birds' lives are so filled with danger that they're on alert at all times, just to stay alive. Luckily, they have several tactics to avoid becoming the next meal for a cat or hawk. One, of course, is to fly away, a good choice, but not always possible. Another is to call in a troop of other birds to set up such a clamor that the predator is driven from the neighborhood. But in cases where the threat is too close and too dangerous, birds freeze in hiding while making soft, high-pitched sounds that serve as a warning to other birds. In our own backyards, the birds likeliest to call out high-danger warnings are robins and chickadees, and many wild creatures recognize such calls . Catbirds, sparrows, finches and nuthatches dash for safety when they hear a robin's barely-audible-to-humans ""seet-seet"" sound, because they know a bird-eating hawk is hunting nearby. Even chipmunks, red squirrels and woodchucks heed these warnings , running on their short legs for cover. Bird warning calls work across species Studies in recent years by many researchers, including Dr. Greene, have shown that animals such as birds, mammals and even fish recognize the alarm signals of other species. Some can even eavesdrop on one another across classes. Red-breasted nuthatches listen to chickadees. Dozens of birds listen to tufted titmice, who act like the forest‚Äôs crossing guards. Squirrels and chipmunks eavesdrop on birds, sometimes adding their own thoughts. ... Studying the phenomenon, he documented a ‚Äúdistant early-warning system‚Äù among the birds in which the alarm calls were picked up by other birds and passed through the forest at more than 100 miles per hour. Dr. Greene likened it to a bucket brigade at a fire. When Birds Squawk, Other Species Seem to Listen Chipmunks make these calls, too, Greene noticed. He was astonished that mammals and birds ‚Äî biological families as different as mice and magpies ‚Äî would share this early warning system. ""We've got these complex communication networks,"" Greene explains, ""and it's not just one species yakking to members of its own kind.

22270,,How do people deal with sweating and 'feeling hot' at high altitude climbs (above 5500m)?,Layering and wicking,"Layering and wicking. Back to layering and wicking in a minute, but first note that 3,000 meters (9,842 feet) isn't really all that high compared to what you are aiming for, which is above 5,500 meters (18,045 feet). That extra 8,000 plus feet means a temperature drop of 16 degrees F (9 degrees C) to 24 degrees F (13 degrees C), more if you go higher. There may also be stronger winds higher up. This will be at least partially (maybe completely) offset by the lack of shade, higher insolation from above, and greater reflection from below and the sides if there is snow. The extreme variation in temperature that you will feel, sometimes in a matter of minutes, from shifting cloud cover and moving cloud patterns and varying wind patterns makes layering absolutely essential. From Chapter Five in Doctor on Everest by Kenneth Kamler, MD on climbing in the Western Cwm (6,000 meters to 6,800 meters): The sun came out, and I stopped to remove my jacket and balaclava, but by the time I got them off and into my pack, the sky clouded over and I had to take them out again. Earlier in the chapter, Kamler says: It was getting hot. I took off a layer of clothes and switched from my wool hat to my wide brimmed sun hat. A bit later, Kamler and his companions faced heat exhaustion: Our last precaution [after we each drank a liter of water] was to strip down to a single layer of polypropylene ...Sustained exertion could cause dangerous heat buildup, so we'd finish the climb in our long underwear. The next day, Kamler was out on an acclimatization hike despite a freezing wind and wondering where the Cwm was that I had climbed yesterday in my underwear.

For the boots I had, and military/long walking events experience: Tougher boots take longer to break in, simply because the material is less flexible and takes time to 'form' around your feet (if they do it at all, hence some plastic kind of snow boats).

Some take much longer, how long depends on person by person, and by how much distance they walked to break in the shoes. I hard there are some tips to lower the break in time (or the consequences): Some people fill their shoes with water and leave it for a day; than remove the water, and put (thin news)paper inside to soak up the remaining water (do not dry them in front of a heater).

3008,,How should I correctly use poles and other equipment to avoid back pain on long hikes?,shoulder straps,"I never understood the appeal of trekking poles until I started carrying 80+ lbs packs down into the bottom of the Grand Canyon for a living. Now, I wish I had started using them sooner. Perhaps my knees would be in better shape. Trekking poles, used properly, can take countless TONS of cumulative weight off your knees and lower back by shifting that weight (and impact) to your arms. They excel at ascents and descents (and their benefits are more noticeable) but can also add some benefit on relatively level walking. There are lots of guides to tell you the ""proper"" way to use them, but in my experience, every person uses them a little differently. But, in general: planting your right pole in front of you as you step your left leg forward while consciously engaging your arm to take some weight off your lower body as you step your right leg forward (while planting your left pole). Follow through with the stroke, and you can even push yourself forward a bit before bringing your pole back to the front. It takes some getting used to, and to incorporate it into your stride. As for other gear / techniques to help with back (and other) pain: They say a properly fitted pack should put about 70% of the weight on a comfortable, well-fitted hip belt, with 30% on the shoulders. (I personally prefer about 95 - 100% on my hips, using my shoulder straps to just keep the pack balanced upright, with no downward weight.) Think about your stride . Do you heel strike? Try landing more on the balls of your feet to reduce jarring impact with each step. (And to build some awesome calves like tree burls.) Good practice: walk barefoot on hard floors / cement (without weight -- or with, you choose) and see how quickly your heels start to complain. Yoga -- both as a regular part of your life, and while on the trail. A few sun salutations in the morning goes a long way toward limbering up the spine for a day of hiking.

Where the lines are further apart, the slope is gentler. In a spot where you see several lines merge together, that is a sheer drop-off. Avoid those, obviously. Look for nesting Vs on the map.

Sorry, I can‚Äôt describe a technique for that. * Perhaps I am recommending spending time poring over contour maps ;‚Äî) Be aware of the scale of the map and the level of elevation change for the map.

I have gotten myself into some difficulty expecting the terrain to be not so bad, but finding it quite steep in 3-D. Also, realize that because of the nature of maps, there can be an awful lot of terrain variety hiding between two contour lines.

Give that the accuracy of your GPS under some conditions is probably about the same as this, more points won't really help.

From a safety point of view the GPS should provide your position irrespective of the route you have set. So this should not be a factor. Reading your question again I think you might actually be talking about saving the route you've been. In any case my point on the distance per point still stands. A quick look at the model in question shows that 2000 is the number of locations you can save. It can save 200 routes each of (up to)? 10000 points.

I basically agree with Olin Lathrop's answer : You don't, or at least shouldn't. As you say, it's public property, not yours. What you are asking is no different from how to leave garbage around your campsite so that casual observers won't see it. It's just plain irresponsible, and probably illegal. But there is something you can do about it. You may want to use "" Augmented Reality "". It's really easy: just download an app like for example WallaMe or Augment and set up your hints. Share them with your friends and thus make them visible when they (your friends) hover over the places with their phone's cam. The description from Google Play: Hide messages in the real world using augmented reality. Leave a message on the wall, or somewhere in a real place, that can be seen only by those you want. It's a funny way to hide private messages in public places. Take a picture of a wall near you, add pictures or freehand sketches and share your creation with your friends. Your augmented reality wall can then be viewed by your friends when they are in the location where you created it. You can also make your wall public, so everyone passing by the physical location can use the WallaMe unique viewer to see your augmented reality Wall. WallaMe makes creating your own virtual reality easy - be creative with beautiful stencils, freehand drawing tools, geolocation and image sharing features. Enjoy the live image stream of public walls being created worldwide within the WallaMe app. There are even a few geocaches ( quoted example ) which use this technology: Augmented reality (AR) is not all that new but it has become more popular with the proliferation of mobile devices such as phones and tablet/pads. I was first exposed to it by my son who was playing a game on his Gameboy. The game came with marker cards that made 3D characters from the game appear in the air hovering over the card. Now, AR lets you use your mobile device to see things that are not really there. There are apps that let you use your smart phone or tablet to scan your surroundings and show photo links, advertisements, directions, etc. It is like a cool, secret world that only folks ""in the know"" can discover. AR works by using some kind of tag or marker. That marker tells your mobile device to display the predetermined image or information at that spot. Markers can be something like the printed card in this geocache listing, a logo or photograph, or they can even be a physical GPS coordinate- meaning that if you stand in a certain spot and use some AR apps you will see the hidden information. If you want more information about AR look up Wikitude or Google Project Glasses. Click the following link and print the special marker page image. This sheet is the key to it all and makes the magic happen. It is the same jpg included in the gallery of this cache listing. Place it on a horizontal, well lit surface in front of you. Now all you need to do is to obtain a free AR app called Augment. It is available for Android and iPhone users. The first time you run the app it takes you directly to the camera. Please hit your BACK button or navigate to the home screen of the app. Then touch the logo in the top left corner of your screen in order to expand a menu from the left side. (That is how it works on my Droid. iPhone users may have to do something different). Choose SCAN. This will active your device's camera so you can point it at the USCGA logo shown below. You don't have to print the logo. You can just use the camera pointed at the screen. This information is quite important for ""Augment"" because it works you around printing the ""data cards"": NOTE-- Some cachers have figured out how to do the AR portion of this cache puzzle using two phones instead of printing the marker sheet. They use one device to display the marker and the other device to do the scanning. (...)

19703,,How accurate is the 3.5 - 5 degree F temperature drop per 1000 feet rule of thumb?,most of the time the estimated rate will be correct,"TLDR : The rate is accurate unless you have an inversion , in which case it is completely inaccurate as the temperature will actually increase above a certain altitude. With increasing height, air temperature within the troposphere and mesosphere drops uniformly with altitude at a rate of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius per 1000 meters - known as the environmental lapse rate. However, sometimes this normal overall decline is reversed. A point or layer at which the temperature increases with height is called inversion or inversion layer. Temperature inversions frequently occur in anticyclones, but are also common in depressions when air in the middle troposphere subsides. Weather facts: Inversion Given the right conditions, the normal vertical temperature gradient is inverted such that the air is colder near the surface of the Earth. This can occur when, for example, a warmer, less-dense air mass moves over a cooler, denser air mass. This type of inversion occurs in the vicinity of warm fronts, and also in areas of oceanic upwelling such as along the California coast in the United States. With sufficient humidity in the cooler layer, fog is typically present below the inversion cap. An inversion is also produced whenever radiation from the surface of the earth exceeds the amount of radiation received from the sun, which commonly occurs at night, or during the winter when the angle of the sun is very low in the sky. This effect is virtually confined to land regions as the ocean retains heat far longer. In the polar regions during winter, inversions are nearly always present over land. Inversion (meteorology) At Fairbanks the inversion strength peaked on Saturday morning, right under the ridge axis, with a temperature difference of 60¬∞F between the surface (-19¬∞F) and 3000' above ground (+41¬∞F). This is essentially a tie with the strongest inversion ever measured by radiosonde in Fairbanks; the record inversion was just 0.1¬∞C stronger in December 1956. Here's the so-called skew-T diagram.

21000,,How can a Common Kingfisher bird balance on a tiny swaying reed without moving its head?,complex compensatory movements of the neck,"This is called gaze stabilization and birds do it to keep one thing in focus even while their body is moving. What is head stabilization in birds? When the body of a bird is held in the hand and rotated or moved in different directions the head often appears ‚Äòlocked in space‚Äô or glued to the spot, and does not move with the rest of the body. To maintain this stable position the bird has, of course, to make complex compensatory movements of the neck. Bird head stabilization Thanks in part to a large number of vertebrae and muscles in their neck, birds can hold their head in place even when their body‚Äôs in motion. According to David Lentink, an assistant professor at Stanford University who studies biological flight, this adaptation helps birds stream high-resolution visuals when moving quickly through complex terrain. ‚ÄúThey keep their head absolutely horizontal at all cost because that way they have the most reliable information, which they have to stream at high rates,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre maneuvering like crazy . . . you need a perfect vision platform.‚Äù ... Gaze stabilization in birds is complex and still poorly understood, Lentink says. But what we do know is that it‚Äôs controlled in part by visual input and the vestibular system, a sensory system in the inner ear in charge of balance and spatial orientation. Like a three-dimensional level, the vestibular system (which other vertebrates have, as well) governs spatial orientation, and it‚Äôs critical for keeping the head steady.

It looks good so far - the join is like a less tidy version of the seam in my first picture, as I erred on the side of generosity with the glue. The seals, which are made of 2 mm neoprene are now tighter by about 1 cm (wrist) and 2 cm (neck). As I stretch the wrist seals over my hands they appear to behave the same as the original seams. Here's the process, based the instructions for the glue I used: Cut a dart out of the seal. Glue the cut edges together keeping the seal flat (like patching an inner tube: coat both faces to be glued, allow to go tacky, stick together). Blind stitch the cut edges together (the glue instructions say the edges should be clipped together for a hour but I wanted seomthing more permanent as can be seen on the original seals) Coat the reinforcing tape and the seal around the join with glue. Allow to dry for several hours. The instructions call this a primer coat. I worked it well into the stitching. Apply another layer of glue to both surfaces, wait 2 minutes and stick together. After that had dried fully I worked a little more glue into the edges of the patch and the back of the seam. This may not have been necessary. I plan to dust it with talc before packing it away to make sure it doesn't stick where it shouldn't, but have left it spread out.

Carry a Supply of Water ... probably the only realistic option. Val Marie drinks reverse osmosis water and I took the advice of the rangers and took a supply of such reverse-osmosis water with me. I took a large supply in the car, making sure to start well hydrated in general: a generous drink right before leaving the car plus a realistically large supply on my hike - April isn't that hot out there, but the generally dry air together with the wind means that one does need more drinking water than, say, hiking Vancouver Island in the fog. The water in Val Marie that is not intended for drinking is not de-salted. It doesn't taste good (I tried), but it can be used directly e.g. for showering and it will not leave you with a salt crust like say, swimming in the Mediterranean and then letting yourself dry. Rain water I have a strong suspicion that the topographic map should show most of the little creeks (probably pretty much everything but Frenchman river) as seasonal creeks. At least, I didn't even find puddles in the side coulees where I was (but then that region doesn't get that much snow - I know the preceding winter had uncommonly large amounts of snow in Winnipeg, but I don't know whether that snow extended so far west). The soil is basically gravel with hardly any topsoil: coulees form easily due to water/wind (and nowadays foot) erosion, but water will drain practically immediately. Environment Canada has historical weather data for Val Marie . Over the last 22 years, the chance to hit a day with > 3mm precipitation was >10% for end of April - August/September, with the maximum approaching 20 % in early June (7 day x 22 year averages). But that's still only 1 out of 5 - 6 days in June and you'd probably need to keep in mind that thunderstorms are not necessarily very good for collecting water via tarp. And it is also hard to plan collecting thunderstorm water, because the precipitation tends to be local. Possibly with the exception of right after a thunderstorm, even if there's water in the small creeks, it will have gone through the salty soil. IIRC I was told that Frenchman river isn't that salty (because it carries water from the Rockies), and that freshwater crabs live there though they have a muddy taste. However, when I was there, there were still some of the dams of the former farms intact. These dams were built to collect rain water for the farm use (human + cattle) and contain fresh water. Whether they are still functional 15 years later, and how they look after the reintroduction of bison I have no idea. But back then they were marked in the map (like each single tree) that was available at the ranger station in Val Marie. Some had a tree and were thus easy to find, and at least towards the end of April they were looking fine in terms of water supply (I didn't try though, because I brought sufficient water and did not bring a water filter). Further considerations: When I was there, the park was just under construction (if you want to call it construction) and it was anyways out of season, so everything was very relaxed (I don't know whether there was any other visitor while I was there). I can well imagine that even if the dams are still functional, park regulations may ask you to not touch that water unless in an emergency. Idea: if you plan to cook pasta, boiling in the salty water may be OK (or not - depending on what salts there are; in particular Mg¬≤‚Å∫ and SO4¬≤‚Åª both bind large amounts of water and cause diarrhea if not vomiting - so taste a drop first).",Carry a Supply of Water,0.469252884,65,88,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/24828

In black bear territory, but prior to seeing a bear: Make noise. The bear will generally move away from you. Just talking and not being stealthy is usually enough. I've seen information for and against the effectiveness of bear bells. They can't hurt but they may not provide anymore protection than just being generally loud. Watch your back. Bears will tail people. I'm aware of multiple cases of people looking behind them only realizing there's a black bear that is following. Don't drop food and don't wipe your hands on your clothes. Do what you can to avoid smelling like a meal. Watch your surroundings. Bears are more likely to be encountered near streams. Also look for trees they have clawed as that means you're in their territory. If you have a dog in black bear country keep it on a leash. There have been cases of dogs aggravating bears then running for their owner/protector... bringing the bear with them. Or my least favorite hiking encounter when a couple said as they passed ""Bears ahead, our dog treed a cub..."" Face the fact that you are not a guest. It is entirely possible that, if hungry enough, even a black bear will decide you are food. If that is the case then no amount of being polite will help you. The vast majority of the time this will not be the case, but that will be of no comfort if you are attacked by a hungry bear. If you do see a black bear: Most times, if you run into a black bear it will just take off. There is really no ""encounter."" Caveat what follows with the fact that I am not a bear expert (as in a biologist who studies and works with bears for living), and this is second hand advice: If you actually encounter a bear checking you out, it is hard to say the correct behavior because that will depend on why the bear is checking you out. Unless you are a bear expert then it's unlikely that you will be able to tell the difference between curiosity, hunger, or other bear reactions/moods. Unfortunately they require different behavior on your part to avoid any unpleasantness. For a 'go to' default: Back away slowly. If it persists and follows you then go with the make noise and look bigger approach (bang hiking sticks, yell, etc). If it charges, stand your ground as it can outrun you anyways and you don't want to look like prey. If it attacks then fight and pray.

11250,,How do you pitch a tarp so that you will not get wet in a heavy rain?,lowered to give a more enclosed space at night,"There are a few different ways to pitch a tarp. In all cases the challenge, compared to a tent which is full self supporting, is that you need to find enough anchor points to be able to pitch it with adequate tension. In fact often the exact configuration you use will be determined by what points you can find to string it up from. A common method is to string a cord between two trees. This requires one of the knots to allow you to adjust the tension in the cord after it is tied as in this video This line form the ridge of the tarp which is slung over it and then itself tensioned with short cords fixed to the ridge line with a prusik hitch or similar. Then the four corners are tensioned with guy lines to ground level fixed to pegs, rocks or other trees. The most important thing about setting it up properly is to be able to tie the proper knots easily, which comes with practice. This is what allows you to tension it properly so that it sheds water effectively and is able to resist the wind. Tarps are most useful in forested or jungle areas where you can be sure that there will be plenty of trees to tie all the lines to and they are often used in conjunction with hammocks as in this type of terrain it is often difficult to find smooth level ground to pitch tent on and it is possible to set up a hammock and tarp camp on extremely rough and sloping ground where a tent would be impractical. On particular advantage compared to a tent is that it is quite versatile for example it can be set up quite high and wide to provide a shelter for cooking, drying clothes or other admin during the day and then lowered to give a more enclosed space at night. Similarly, with practice and in the right terrain they can be set up and taken down quickly enough to be used for rest break in bad weather. It is also possible to use a tarp as the basis of an improvised tent using poles carried with you or found locally. This can be a useful stop gap if there are no trees etc around but can be an awkward compromise between a proper tent and the bets use of a tarp and if you want an ultralight system you may be better off with a bivi bag, but this very much depends on the precise circumstances you are expecting.",lowered to give a more enclosed space at night,0.074776813,1618,1664,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11250

Plastic, not metal spring between the ear chunks. The metal ones always caught my hair when I adjusted the length. Adjustable length. Especially important if you have either small or large skull. Bright colour. Harder to lose. Other things for keeping ears toasty: ear bands Same material as toques, but usually with a tighter weave and more stretch material. These generally do not resize to different shaped skulls. As a fathead, I found most of these were painfully tight. Verify that ear bands cover the entire ear. When stretched, they narrow. I have frequently seen tops and lobes of ears get frostbitten. toques Knit hats, watchman's cap, mitten-hat. If you have a large head then check the length that it will cover all your ears. I prefer a toque that is long enough that I can fold it double over my ears. balaclava Ski-mask. These are long enough to reach below your chin, and have either 1 large opening for eyes and nose, or 3 openings for eyes and nose. hoods Hoods don't do much directly for your ears, unless they have a drawstring around the face. But they will funnel warm air from your torso forcing it to pass by your ears on the way out. And they will reduce the wind chill on your ears. Hoods do funny things with sounds. (I almost had a group hit by a train because we didn't hear the train until it was only about 200 yards behind use (about 5 seconds) It was a seldom used line, which is a nice excuse that holds no water) In cold weather (-30 C) I like a balaclava,which I then roll up so I have 2-4 layers over my ears. In really cold weather (-45 C) I wear a balaclava AND a toque. Toques and balaclavas both are often available at the dollar store. I get them there 3 at a time, since I'm always losing them. Fabrics and material: Only the earbands really require spandex. With earmuffs, the spring between the two parts does that job. With the other two, the nature of being knit, and the large overlap on the ear were sufficient. The most common materials are acrylic (derived from cellulose) polyester (derived from petrochemicals) and wool. Acrylic is usually knit, polyester is usually in the form of fleece. Wool can be knit or felted. The latter is uncommon, and has little stretch, so must be fitted less casually. Acrylic is usually cheaper, which, if you tend to put down your ear coverings when you get hot, can much less painful to your long term wallet health. Polyester is tougher, tends to last longer. I find that fleeces are too permeable to air. You need something in addition to keep that insulating air next to your ears. With knit fabrics, the finer knits are less permeable. Spandex is a material used to add stretchyness. Not needed in a knit fabric, but often used as a component in woven fabrics. Since earbands tend to be tighter on the head they may be lined with a nylon or synthetic tricot (smooth finish) fabric to make them slide on and off more easily, as well as to avoid leaving knit-prints on your ears. I have occasionally had cotton toques. They work, but are subject to all the ailments of cotton: Not as warm as either synthetic or wool; absorb water, and are hard to dry. Ok for a bus ride or errand day in town. Not recommended for back country. I prefer acrylic. Doesn't itch as much, is much lighter weight dries in a flash, doesn't shrink if you wash it in hot water. Colorfast. Headwear tends to get frost from your breath. Acrylic gear can be removed, whipped against a tree trunk a few times (Try to avoid the pitch...) and put on again. You will leave about 80% of the frost behind. If you are in wet weather a lot, there is something to be said for wool, but my dislike of wool (for ears) is far stronger than wool's small advantage. Acrylic tends to be a lot cheaper.",spandex,0.165915713,2243,2250,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15019
19028,,How to use a static rope as a tether at the anchor of a top rope climb?,Attach yourself to the tether with a Gri-Gri,"Here is what I have done in the past and have demonstrated for others. Attach yourself to the tether with a Gri-Gri and tie backup knots beneath you to prevent a catastrophic failure of the Gri-Gri losing its grip and you sliding all the way down the rope. Its unlikely that the Gri-Gri would fail, but you still want to tie the knots in case and as good practice. The point of tieing the knots is that if the Gri-Gri were to slip, the knots would stop you from sliding past them. Just a simple figure-eight on a bight or an overhand on a bight will work (make the bights good and large). The Gri-Gri makes it really easy to go up and down the rope as you need and it means you don't need to constantly adjust knots in the rope. The backup knots are really easy to tie and they shouldn't get weighted, making them easy to untie.",Attach yourself to the tether with a Gri-Gri,0.065917149,71,115,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19028

You can watch a GPS to make sure the speed is around zero (and the anchor is not dragging) when you're doing this. However, if the tide and/or wind changes, it can pull out a set anchor. If you use a LOT of chain and it's not too windy and the current is not too swift, the boat will only drag the chain around and won't actually pull on the anchor. Also, if it does pull the anchor up and you have a lot of chain out, it's likely to catch again somewhere nearby (unless it goes over a ledge into deep water). Some people will set two anchors, one in each direction of the tide. I don't think I could do that without ending up with a tangled mess of chain.

3115,,How to be safe on lake and river ice and what should I do when I fall through?,concider width and speed of the current,"When it's possible you will be crossing ice on your route, there is a couple of stages: Planning at home First of all, you should explore the area of your trip. The question is are the water sources frozen and how thick is the ice Small lakes in the forest, where there is no winds and no water flow, freeze first. If you know that a couple of small lakes in the area froze a week or two ago, then you can assume that all the other have probably frozen too. Big lakes, which are visible from satellites, can be checked directly on MODIS daily satellite images . After you find the lake on the image (which is difficult) you can tell if it's frozen by its color: white is frozen, dark is open water. If the lake is frozen, you should check a week or two back to see if it was already frozen and there were any chances for the ice to thicken. Very big lakes (like, >100 km^2) may be partially frozen for months. You can see it on the images. You'll have smooth white fields near the shores (fixed ice), dark open water in the middle, and mixed dark/white pattern in between - floating ice. The trick is that fixed ice may split off and start floating any time, if it's near the edge (and sometimes far from the edge too). On the other hand, sometimes local authorities publish ice coverage maps for very big lakes. Rivers are very treacherous. You can examine other rivers to roughly estimate that there is (or isn't) some ice on your river, but you should concider width and speed of the current. But river ice is not uniform and most rivers have areas open during the whole winter (where the current is faster and at shallow places). They may be very hard to detect, so you'd better just cross rivers and avoid walking along the river. And give the ice some time to thicken. This depends on the temperature much. I'm not going to give any numbers here, each case is unique. If you are going far from home, it's wise to ask locals about ice situation. Estimating on the spot Now you are following your route and have a (probably) frozen water in front of you. It doesn't mean you have to cross it. First, think it over again, because going back is less evil than dying or having your chilblain fingers amputated. Check if there is any trace of open water. Avoid areas, where snow seems darker or lower. Avoid areas near water plants and rocks. If it's spring, avoid areas near shores (they unfreeze faster). Stop right away if you feel vibration or hear cracking. Never test ice strength with a kick of you foot, use a long pole instead (this applies mostly to crossing rivers, because you are not going to strike with a pole after each step on a big lake). Unfortunately, there is no method to test that the ice is 99% safe. You are the closest when you know that a couple of people (N times as heavy as you/your party) have crossed it 5 minutes ago, but still... Yes, you can use an ice screw to test ice thickness, but you can't do it all the time. Alleviating the concequences of accidents If you have fallen into the water, it's very difficult to escape yourself: you are cold you get stiffer every second you may panic ice is too slippery and/or too fragile to climb your clothes and equipement (backpack, skies) make it much worse there may be underwater currents pulling you under the impenetrable ""roof"" of thick ice The main advice is Have another person following ( but not closely! ). He will have much more chances to help you. He should have a rope ready (you too, because he might accidently fall). He should not come too close to avoid following you into the water. He should be quick. You both shouldn't panic. He will have much better success starting fire (or calling ambulance). Other advices are: Drop your equipement as fast as possible (your backpack's belt should be unfastened all the time and you ski binding should allow underwater unfasteneing). Drop your heavy clothes too, it's wet anyway. Have a personal awl (a sharp metallic piece with a handle) very accessible (like hanging at your sholder) to climb slippery ice. Or at least use youe ski poles, etc. Have matches/lighter in a waterproof package close to skin, so that you can start a fire immediately after rescue. If it's possible, have an inflatable boat with you (I mean, inflated and tied to a roap in your hand). A warm diving suit + lifejacket + a boat make crossing not-so-frozen lakes quite easy and safe (tried it myself). When you are out it's very important to get warm ASAP. And if the warming has to be delayed, move intensively. If you don't feel your fingers, swing your arm/leg about 50 times like a pendulum with full force. If you still can't feel the fingers, you can only save them by slowly warming it. And, yes, fingers are not as important as life. Bottom line Ice safety is very complex and this topic can't cover anything. Take ice seriously. Really. It's deadly and it's not an exaggeration. Lots of unprepared people fall and die each winter. And I know half a ski-tour group with an experienced leader drown two years ago on a big lake. I know two sportsman lost their fingers after unsuccessfully crossing a small river. I know a very experienced and fully prepared man escaped just with a couple of deep cuts on his face - he was lucky. If you seriously plan crossing ice in a remote area, please be prepared, find a book or big article on the subject, consult with an experienced one and use your brains. And still it's solely your responsibility.",concider width and speed of the current,0.469297558,1455,1494,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3115

I like to find trails, areas, that are less crowded in general, and estimate the seasonal pattern mostly on availability. Signs of less popular areas: A relative lack of photos on things Google Photos, Flickr, Instagram, etc. A relative lack of uploaded tracks on sites such as Wikiloc and Alltrails . A relative lack of google hits for places uniquely along this particular trail. A general lack of information online. A lack of services in the area. Trails not mapped on Openstreetmap; for example, as of 2020, Openstreetmap maps only two trails skirting the corners of the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana (USA), but the National Geographic Trails Illustrated map (which can be browsed online) betrays a relatively dense network of trails throughout the wilderness. Look through some of the websites listed at the answers to this opposite question on Travel Stack Exchange , which essentially asks what's hot right now . My most recent hike was at spectacular B√∏rgefjell ( photos ) and I met nobody, and indeed, it's completely black on sightsmap , as is the part of Iceland I hiked in the year before ( photos ). Check the Strava heatmap , or other heatmaps. If you can't see the trail you want to hike, it's probably not too crowded. If I had looked at the Strava heatmap for the Grand Canyon Corridor Trail (extremely bright), I could have mentally prepared for the hundreds of trail runners 24 hours per day rather than expecting the total number of hikers to be limited by the total number of overnight permits. Compare quiet Grasslands National Park or deserted Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument (invisible ‚Äî Americas best kept secret?). Although running is not a perfect substitute for hiking, it surely correlates. Note that The same color only locally represents the same level of heat data , so although this method may find relatively less crowded trails in the same state park, you can't compare between areas far apart. I don't know if/how the Strava heatmap works when there is no mobile phone coverage (does it upload later or is it marked as unvisited?). Of course, this has the marked disadvantage that it's also harder to find those areas at all. It helps to know the area, to get a good map that includes not only popular trails but also less popular ones, etc. In northern Scandinavia, I've almost never met another hiker in routes that I designed on my own (though in some areas I have frequently come across people fishing or hunting recreationally, unaware that a specific area had been recently recommended in a popular paper fishing magazine that I don't read).",Strava heatmap,0.139368117,1199,1213,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4187

The key is that ice can support your weight in boots and not yet be safe for dynamic or concentrated loads (i.e. jumping or ice skating). The basic technique is that you first bash the edge of the ice (it is always thinnest at the edge), and look at the thickness underwater. If your bashing put a lot of cracks in the ice or the ice moved on the water, it isn't safe enough to step on. Then you step on the ice -- if it cracks and seems springy, you jump off. Then you jump up and down -- if that's ok, you go out a few feet and look at the ice at slanted angle. Because clear ice refracts light differently depending on its thickness, with a little bit of practice, you can see if the ice is 4""+ thick. In general, if it is 2"" or less, a well-driven ski pole will go through it, and if you jump, it it will crack and water will come up through the cracks.

16367,,"How does water depth affect swimming safety? Why do signs, especially in the UK, say ""DANGER: deep water""?",to ban swimming to cover themselves,"Well, there's the obvious issue that the bottom may shelve very steeply, so that non-swimmers trying to paddle may drown. Beyond that, I think there's a specific point and a more general point. Specifically, deep water is more dangerous in terms of cold water shock . In the first 3-5 minutes after entering cold water there can be a gasp reflex or muscle spasms that might cause intake of water into the lungs. Also, blood pressure and heart rate are raised, which can cause heart problems or stroke. Deep water will remain colder than shallow water. And if the swimmer gets into trouble, they will likely be out of their depth. Also, as has been pointed out in the comments, the banks will often be steep and harder to exit. The accidents tend to happen to young men with a macho approach to cold water. According to RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents): Cold water shock can be prevented by people getting in slowly and acclimatising themselves to the water But many of these young men tend to jump in and swim out 50 metres (150ft). All of a sudden, cold water shock kicks in. It has nothing to do with how strong a swimmer you are - if you look at triathletes, they wear wetsuits to protect themselves against the shock of the water. More generally, it seems that Local Authorities are increasingly taking a US-style legally defensive attitude to any risky activity. Increasingly their reflex is simply to ban swimming to cover themselves. So from this perspective the notice may simply be an excuse for a ban. Here's the response of an official to an Outdoor Swimming Society petition for access to a lake: Only if the Outdoor Swimming Society can strictly control and manage swimming on the lake, including providing and paying for the appropriate signage, safety measures, public liability insurance and cover of lifeguarding facilities all year round - and this council can be satisfied that all the necessary safety precautions are put in place and be indemnified against any incidents that may occur - will the council reconsider its position. Good grief - talk about over the top! This was in a lake where sailing and canoeing were allowed, and the Society was asking why swimming had been singled out.

Light attenuation due to windshield angle . When the windshield is directly facing the sun, relatively little of the sunlight is reflected. However, when the sunlight is hitting the windshield at a glancing angle, a significant fraction of the light is reflected and therefore not transmitted to where it hits the solar panel. Decreased panel efficiency due to temperature . The efficiency of solar panels goes down with increased temperature, becoming 0 at about 150 ¬∞C. Usually there will be more air flow around a panel that is by itself outside than inside the car on the dashboard.

The plastic in our clothing is largely inert, but it is subject to mechanical wear and tear. Every time you wash your plastic clothing small bits of bit are broken off, and are distributed throughout the environment. How far they go depends on how your waste water is managed. These small bits of of plastic are called microplastics . Microplastics are now ubiquitous in the oceans. One concern is that they are being swept up at the bottom of the food chain in plankton and filter-feeders. From the wiki link: It can take at least 14 days for microplastics to pass through an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' gills can prevent elimination entirely.[50] When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders. For example, scientists have reported plastic accumulation in the stomachs of lantern fish which are small filter feeders and are the main prey for commercial fish like tuna and swordfish.[59] Microplastics also absorb chemical pollutants that can be transferred into the organism's tissues.[60] Small animals are at risk of reduced food intake due to false satiation and resulting starvation or other physical harm from the microplastics. This is an area of active research and the actual harm to wildlife and particularly to humans is still being debated. Whether end-consumer clothing is a significant source of microplastics compared to fishing gear and industrial sources is also hotly debated.

I've actually had this experience as well when walking along a canal with my husband, a narrow boat owners dog followed us for a good 200 yards before we walked him back and got them to take him inside. Unfortunately with a stray, or dogs that are allowed to freely wander, there's usually no one to give them back to. What are the implications(If there are any) when a few dogs/puppies decide to stick with you on a hike? From the dogs point of view: For a stray dog probably very little, most dogs have a good directional sense and can probably make it back to wherever they call home without an issue. For an owned dog walking free probably again little - however, if the dog has tags, try and return it to its owner as it may have actually wandered off without them wanting it to. For any puppy depending on age, probably this is the least favourable walking companion as for one, puppies don't have fully developed bones until approximately a year old, their bones are soft, and long hikes are never advised by vets until about 6 months old. They can damage their bones when they're still soft from walking too much. Also, puppies are much more susceptible to diseases like parvovirus, and other viruses which are spread by rats urine (commonly found along rivers and water sources). From a hikers point of view: Irritation is probably the biggest factor. You may find issues if the dogs are aggressive or there are a large number of them in a pack. If this is the case, try avoiding going near the dogs in the first place. This answer gives great information about dealing with wild dogs, especially if they are aggressive. How do you shoo away a stubborn dog/dogs/pup/puppies, for their own safety? The usual way to get a dog to stop unwanted behaviour is to ignore them - this is a very powerful tool for a human as dogs want eye contact. Don't look at the dog and don't speak to it.

There's a wave of people reaching the age where they start getting serious trouble walking, and compared to previous generations they're on average relatively well off financially. And then there's patents. If someone found the key technology to this concept today they'd have twenty years to monetize it. Given that people love money, the right patent in the right hands could make everything happen very fast, making a deployment ten years from now realistic. Eventually the price should stabilize somewhere around the cost of a new scooter (or an electric scooter for powered versions, whichever ends up winning). The skeleton has more weird moving parts and needs to get more strength out of less material, but it does require less material and no power. So maybe it will even go as low as a bicycle at some point. For the first five or ten years after coming out they're going to be considerably more expensive though. There is always the option of ""never"", but I'd say that if these things are going to happen, they're going to happen relatively soon. If not then either the technology didn't work after all or we found something better. So for the next ten to forty years, I think we need to make do with bicycles, with all the cons and pros they carry. But there are realistic reasons for optimism.",twenty years,0.292746425,179,191,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15941
21731,,"How can I tell if there's a camouflaged octopus in a coral reef, so I can keep from disturbing it?",to keep your distance from reefs,"When building their nest, octopus usually place some kind of shiny object at the entrance to find the place back if they leave. They probably don't for their eggs, as they don't leave them, but you never know. In any case, the best way to ensure you won't disturb them is to keep your distance from reefs, so that you don't scare them. Another thing to be carefull for, and most divers completely disregard, is the water flux created by your fins. This flux can be powerfull, removing little organisms (algaes and crustaceans) that were holding onto the rock. I believe it is strong enough to force an octopus to move, even to damage the eggs if applied directly.",to keep your distance from reefs,0.084284417,272,304,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21731
22211,,How much margin due to charging inefficiency should I add when calculating the size of batteries needed for a trip?,50%,"The overall efficiency from a power bank to a smartphone battery is about 2/3 , according to this source: https://www.powerbankguide.com/powerbank-capacity-explained/ The amount of energy a battery can provide depends on its voltage (nominal 5V for a USB power bank), the size of the supplied current in Amperes and how long the current can be kept flowing. Since the voltage is fixed (5V), current and time are sufficient to express the capacity of a power bank. The units of current and time are then used together: 10,000 mAh means that a current of 10,000 mA (milli Ampere, so actually 10 A) could be provided for 1 h, or 5 A for 2 h, or, since common charging currents for mobile phones are around 2 A, this current could be provided for 5 h. To get 10,000 mAh on the smartphone side, about 15,000 mAh will be drawn from the power bank. In other words, the required margin is about 50% of the desired capacity.",50%,0.490508676,887,890,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/22211
4708,,How do you dry wet socks when camping/backpacking if it's raining and the socks cannot be hung to dry outside,Sleeping with the socks on your torso,"Sleeping with the socks on your torso is the most effective method I have found, and it does not require anything you wouldn't already have. For this, you just: Take socks off Put them inside your shirt, under all layers of clothing. They should be touching your skin. Sleep Wake up in the morning with dry socks. This works with a lot of things: socks, gloves, hats, anything that could get wet. You don't need a fire, extra fuel, towels, hand warmer, etc... Putting the socks on your legs also works but your core is a much warmer furnace. A good meal before you go to sleep goes a long way. You can dry clothing during the day (while you hike) using the same method, just make sure they don't fall out. Sometimes, I put them inside an inner pocket. I always carry two pairs of socks: one to wear and one to dry. I alternate every night and morning, so that I am constantly wearing dry socks. I have found this to be critically important to be comfortable while being cold or wet. NOTE: I am assuming synthetic or wool socks. Wearing cotton socks in the outdoors is generally a bad idea. After a few days of this method, your sleeping bag will start to accumulate some moisture (especially bad with down bags), so it's a good idea to dry it out when the weather clears.",Sleeping with the socks on your torso,0.063256271,0,37,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4708
21360,,How do simple compass needles remain level instead of see-sawing with magnetic dip? Are they flat even near the poles?,balancing a compass for a specific zone,"The short answer is that the manufacturers know about this problem and have taken steps to correct the problem caused by the variance in the dips as you move up and down the earth. It can be done in one of two ways, either balancing a compass for a specific zone, which will limit the compass's usefulness to that zone, or a special global compass that has enough movement to work anywhere regardless of your position. Any practical magnetic compass must show the horizontal component of the local magnetic field line to be precise. To accomplish this without having to manually compensate for the natural tilt in the magnetic lines, compass manufacturers usually use the weight of the needle or card to account for the vertical component of the magnetic field. This is referred to as magnetic zone balancing. ... Suunto‚Äôs globally balanced needles use a construction where the needle and the magnet tilt independently of each other. This allows the needle to stay parallel with the compass capsule while the magnet tilts with the vertical component of the earth magnetic field without pulling down the needle. Understanding balancing zones In order to get an accurate reading from a compass, the compass needle needs to be ""balanced"" in the capsule, so it does not drag on the top or bottom of the capsule. But, because the horizontal and vertical components of the earth's magnetic field vary considerably in different locations, a compass needle that ""balances"" perfect in North America will drag or stick in South America. As a result of these magnetic variances, the compass industry has divided the earth into 5 ""zones""... What is a Global Needle? This is why a compass used in the Northern Hemisphere won't work in the Southern unless it uses a global needle.",balancing a compass for a specific zone,0.013619308,223,262,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21360

21098,,How do you protect yourself against crocodiles when you have no option but to camp on the banks of a croc-infested river?,rotating shifts of sentry,"If I were in such a situation, and not alone, my best bet would be rotating shifts of sentry. When its about camping, the whole problem escalates when everyone is asleep, or more evidently when someone is doing the dishes after dinner, or things like that. Though you stand chances that you can outrun a crocodile on land, the risk is maximum in initial attacking moments. Remember, they are quicker than we can imagine. Pick a place which is at least a 50 m away from river Pick a place which is not very nearby sliding tracks/marks of crocodiles, I can't think of a safer distance in numbers, its debatable, but longer the better. As a basic camping habit, do not throw extra/waste edibles around the place where you are camping, this goes without saying irrespective where you are camping. People I know who have apt knowledge about crocodiles have always warned about the schedule one follow. Do not make a schedule/pattern of certain tasks you do when you are camping for a longer time. Example, do not fill water from the same place twice, do not do the dishes at the same place nearby campsite. Crocodiles are smart, and they can ambush based on this kind of deterministic pattern. If you have/want to fish, fish from an elevated bank. Do not doze off while fishing. Keep a companion with you.",rotating shifts of sentry,0.200272515,67,92,https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/21098
